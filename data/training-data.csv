0;1;Every time I move my chair closer to talk to him, he keep fidgeting and moving away. Do I smell ?
1;0;Is it even possible to have onsite learning but online exams?
2;0;Hey law students, quick question are we really required to pay taxes as part-time lab assistants? The pay is not that much (not even 50k per day), and then Binus deducts some ‘tax’... Can someone enlighten me?
4;1;The lab assistant makes me feel all mushy inside, but I know my place—I’m nobody special. Bye ‘S’, I wish you all the best.
5;1;Why do I always feel like crying when I’m angry?
6;2;Oh great, now they say the exam’s fully onsite… Let’s speak up, guys
7;1;Can onsite exams be on Saturdays too or just weekdays?
8;1;"
My crush said something offensive to me, it almost made me felt worthless. Is it stupid if I still like him?
"
9;0;share your internship experiences please, my beloved seniors!
10;1;Whoa why can't BIMOB be opened now?
11;1;Oh, so this is how working life feels. Bored, tired, unmotivated. Definitely gonna be the boss after I graduate
12;1;When will I finally get accepted for an internship?
13;2;Ladies, share your thoughts—what makes a woman choose a guy who’s broke? And another question: what if he’s good-looking but poor?
14;1;Hey, help me out—why do I have some classes scheduled at ASM and others at Anggrek? What’s going on here?
15;2;It’s already June—what does that mean?? IT MEANS THE ASSIGNMENT DEADLINES ARE GETTING CLOSE.
16;0;The courses that have nothing to do with Livestream have a ton of credits, and the ones that actually relate to it barely have any.
17;2;I’m so pissed off at the parking guy at ALS. There was clearly an empty spot right in front of me, I had a class starting soon, so I rolled down my window and said, “Sir, that spot’s empty, and I’m running late for a presentation.” It wasn’t blocked by a parallel car, and it wasn’t even a tight space. But he still wouldn’t let me in. He looked at me, saw me pointing at the empty space that was literally right there. Then he goes, “Can’t park there, Miss. It’s crowded behind.” Like, what the hell? What does that have to do with me? So I had to go all the way around and park at Silkwood. And guess what? When I walked to Sunib, the parking lot behind was open :) and still crowded :) freaking ridiculous.
18;0;Sometimes playing Mobile Legends makes me think—what if family worked like a team in a game? Parents would be like the support or tank, assisting and giving stability to their child as the core/damage dealer so they can “level up” fast, not fall behind, and win the battles of life.
19;0;Looking at the love stories in batch B25, a lot of them seem to be going smoothly... maybe it’s because they had onsite classes? Meanwhile, B24 has been remote for a year and a half and we’ve got zero love stories lmao.
20;0;I’m always the one going to my boyfriend place—whether he’s in Tangerang so we can go back together, or I’m always the one coming over to his house to hang out. He rarely comes to mine, so it feels like I’m putting in too much effort for him. But I can’t really say he’s not trying, because he’s currently looking for a house for us :) What do you guys think?
21;0;What’s the latest time you can park at Binus? Like what time do they lock it at night? I wanna leave my car and go to Moas but I’m scared I won’t be able to get it out.
22;2;I wanna have a baebeeee
23;1;"
she’ll never love u quite like me☺
"
24;0;Aldi Taher is totally my mood, pleaseee. I’d totally vote for him LOL. I don’t even know the other candidates, their only promotion is like one random billboard—zero effort to win over the youth vote.
25;2;"
Idk its been a long time since I ever liked someone, I think i kinda missed the feeling????
"
26;0;I want my final days... to end happily
27;2;So embarrasseddd hmmmm
28;0;I wanna go to campus soon so I can eat Hokben.
29;0;The older I get, the more I realize how important it is to have a partner to talk to, guys.
30;0;What are some of your considerations when joining a new circle, aside from being on the same wavelength? Sorry if this question’s kinda random lol, I’ve just been thinking about it
31;1;Have you guys ever really wanted to make a dancing TikTok, but you're scared someone might find out?
32;0;Hey guys, how do you fill out the logbook? Mine’s still showing “awaiting” on the enrichment website.
33;0;One of my course lecturers once said: “This (class/lecture) is the place for you to make mistakes.” But from the moment we’re born, we’re trained not to make mistakes. Even when we do make them, we often get scolded or punished. Once, the same lecturer asked a student a question, and the student answered with what they thought was right—even though it sounded wrong. Some of the other students laughed, which led the lecturer to say: “Don’t be afraid. Don’t mind your friends’ laughter. Just because they’re laughing doesn’t mean they know the answer either.” Yeah… things like that happen a lot—and probably always will. This is just one of many examples that happen all the time. I don’t even know why it keeps happening. It’s like it’s become part of every generation’s culture. I wonder... if these things didn’t exist, would humans grow into better versions of themselves?
34;0;Is LKC open this Saturday?
35;1;Why are the grades still pending? Feels like texting someone who leaves you on read.
36;2;WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FREAKING LATE
37;0;Does Suncur plan to create a forum for alumni to vent about work?
38;2;Have you ever recognized a special someone’s notification sound, and even after losing contact, you still hear it in your head even though they’re long gone? lol
39;0;I like my own FL (faculty leader). We’ve eaten out, watched movies, even picked each other up. I finally had the guts to confess, and he said he liked me too. But then he added, 'Yeah, I like you — you’re my best mentee.' Nice. Great
40;0;Guys, how many months or years is the internship?
41;1;When will you ever care about me too?
42;1;Please.. is that entrepreneurship lecturer even serious about teaching? Every session we’re told to present something that’s never explained. We don’t even know what we’re supposed to present
43;0;For anyone needing a little healing from the storm of final exams, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0fnqat88IQ
44;1;Not to flex or anything, but I’m pretty, smart, tall, and charming you could say. But still single hahahah :) Please, I’m bored. Not really suffering, but like… just bored, you know
46;1;Other universities have such cozy libraries. Doesn’t Sunib have any plans to renovate?
47;0;Back when I joined GO, there was this super fierce senior guy. He came to our class with a loud voice saying: 'Don’t act cocky just because you can log into Bimay and use Flazz. You’re not students yet, just candidates. Don’t get arrogant.'
48;1;It’s already this late in the month and my final report still hasn’t been approved by my FS
49;1;I miss the Binus Syahdan campus, miss chilling in room R
50;0;Can Suncur points be withdrawn into Binus Flazz balance?
53;0;Who’s coming to campus (onsite) tomorrow?
54;2;BE CAREFUL guys, there's this guy with the initials HI from SOCS who's DISTURBING — he asks for answers and shares them after just changing the names. He invites girls out or to voice calls even though they don’t know him. He pretends it's just a group hangout, but ends up asking for a picture together — and then makes that photo his profile picture. BE CAREFUL if this guy ever chats your female friends!
55;1;Let only Indihome have a bad signal, not our communication..
56;2;I’ve done a few interviews already, but every time one’s coming up, my stomach hurts and I get so scared
57;0;Just want to clarify that FWB (friends with benefits) isn’t always about sex. Giving affection and attention without romantic feelings also counts. It’s fun having an FWB you can hang out with, talk to, cuddle, pat each other’s head, game together, go crazy together — basically everything — but without jealousy if they do it with someone else. Remember, FWB means both sides benefit. If only one does, then you’re just a clown
58;2;Been waiting for the holidays forever, now it’s finally here and I’m SOOOOOO BORED!
59;0;bale bale bale bale
60;1;How do I know if I need to resubscribe to Beelingua? If the Lifepoints are fine, that means it’s okay, right?
61;0;Sunib should partner with Alsut mall for parking. That mall’s empty anyway. Maybe allow Flazz Binus to be used there with the same rates as campus. I don’t mind walking a bit further.
62;0;Something that’s sudden but not round tofu — what is it?
63;1;Who here feels like they’re already a bestie but still not in the Close Friends list
64;2;No matter how high your degree or how many certificates you have, they're useless if you can't help others. Be grateful if you can get an S1 degree. At the very least, IF YOUR GPA IS BAD, DAMN IT, AFTER GRADUATING, HELP PEOPLE. YOUR HELP WILL BE MORE USEFUL TO SOCIETY. — My high school teacher
65;0;Guys, how’s everyone’s thesis proposal going?
66;2;Just found out not all internships listed on Binus' website are paid :)) there’s even this student organization from Binus offering unpaid internships :D I mean, if I were only looking for experience I’d be fine with it, but I’ve got a lot of living expenses, dear God
67;0;Guys, why is there no apply button on the enrichment app?
68;1;During exams at Binus, I always repeat this to myself: 'It’s just a week, you got this, take it slow'
69;1;Do you guys feel uncomfortable when strangers chat you, especially if they insist you reply? Like, what the heck, you’re nobody to me but you keep bothering and forcing me to respond. So annoying.
70;1;Has anyone ever gotten a helix piercing here? Does it hurt a lot? And is it hard to sleep afterward?
71;1;My boyfriend’s ex called his mom yesterday lol. She said she suddenly felt like calling. Is it valid for me to overthink? I’m not mad at anyone, just honestly sad haha.
72;1;Yesterday, the schedule showed only Monday–Thursday. Today, it’s Monday–Saturday
73;0;Does anyone know if we can use the KIP scholarship at Binus? And if yes, where do we take care of it?
75;0;So many notifications from Bruno_Mars omg
76;1;It’s so annoying chatting with someone who just reads your message. I wrote a whole paragraph and even asked a question, but still got no reply.. lol
77;1;Stop sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can happen to anyone, regardless of their ethnicity, nationality, religion, social group, or race
78;1;Tomorrow, something will be empty. Not the heart, but the answer sheet.
79;0;Wanna ask — if I fail a subject and take it again in the short semester, will the grade from that short semester be included in the cumulative GPA? And is there a max grade limit like the minimum competency score (KKM)? Or is it unlimited so the grade can be good?
80;0;If you can’t attend the midterm exam (UTS) onsite due to certain reasons, what should you do?
81;1;The Entrepreneurship (Entre) course at Binus is so ridiculous. Entrepreneurship isn’t just theory — it needs practical experience too. They don’t give us a chance to practice directly, like selling stuff. Unlike the other university.
82;0;Hey I heard that next semester it won’t be mandatory to come on-site? Is that true?
83;0;Anyone know scholarships available for semesters 2–8?

87;0;If I got a D on the midterm, can I still make up for it with the final exam and assignments?
88;0;Thesis supervisor: the state of the art section must be done in one week. Me: Yes ma'am, understood
89;2;I swear something weird and ridiculous happened in my neighborhood. A little kid threw trash into my house and it hit my dad's head... Actually, he’s been throwing trash like that often, but my family kept quiet about it... And since it happened to hit my dad, he told the kid, 'Don’t throw trash into our house, kid.' That’s it, nothing more. That night, the kid’s dad brought the whole neighborhood leaders and even a religious teacher and turned it into a religious issue… Then my dad got confronted and accused of ruining the neighborhood because he’s non-Muslim or something — crazy, right? lol. My dad clarified that he just told the kid and showed the CCTV. In the end, they all apologized, but my dad refused to shake hands because he was already hurt. Now I’m afraid to even go outside because the neighbors seem more hostile... all just because of a naughty kid, everything turned chaotic.
90;2;ASSIGNMENT BATTLE, FROM THE START OF THE SEMESTER UNTIL NOW I’VE DONE 18 ASSIGNMENTS FOR JUST ONE COURSE
91;0;I often bring candy I bought from Glodok and my friend seems to really like it, it’s fruit-flavored with a minty twist. If I sold the candy at Sunib, would it sell? Like doing a pre-order or something.
92;0;Guys I wanna ask, if I got a C in a first semester course but passed, and I retake it and get a better grade, can it raise my first semester GPA?
93;0;I miss hearing all the sounds in the classroom before exams back then..
94;2;Hello guys… I want to share a little. So my parents have a friend who asked me to paint something. They asked via my parents. I saw the example they wanted, drew it, and it was done. Then they asked for a revision — which is normal for art. But after fixing it, my parents didn’t like it and told me to redo it on a new canvas, and even said things like ‘I’d rather pay someone else to paint this.’ I explained that I gave it as a gift to their friend, so I wasn’t asking for payment. In the end, they hired someone else to paint it at a price I thought was too high, then blamed me for not wanting to paint it for free. Now I honestly feel kinda down... I don’t think I want to draw for others anymore.
95;0;Seniors or anyone else, is PT Kawan Lama a good place for an internship? Thanks
96;0;If your friend wants to quit college but it's already halfway, has breakouts, uncontrolled weight, messed up sleep schedule, and keeps saying they want to work soon — maybe they’re in semester 5
97;1;For B25 CS and up who want to intern in semester 5, make sure to practice coding-related hard skills. Internship positions are mostly for FE, BE, app dev, etc. — UI/UX is super rare. Better start now with Laravel/React/etc., and build small projects for your portfolio, so you don’t regret and struggle like I did

111;0;Guys I wanna ask, in semester 5 can we still apply to be a lab assistant?
112;0;Do lab assistants prefer to be called by their name or their code?

123;1;My lecturer once said, just enjoy college, studying is just studying, don’t overthink it as something hard. If you don’t understand, feel free to ask me. The important thing is you understand the knowledge in the book, the grades will follow naturally. I’m not strict in grading, as long as you understand the material, I’ll give you good grades. During the midterm, my project failed so badly I got stressed, but I got a score of 100 — this lecturer is the dream!

128;2;I REALLY NEED TO LEARN NOT TO DO TASKS LAST MINUTE, NO LIES.

133;1;Any tips to get rid of a friend who doesn’t know their place? It’s 2 a.m. and they’re still not leaving, seriously.

145;1;For Sunib students, how many days off do we get after finals? My exams start on the 27th… anyone got the info?
146;2;It’s not even three weeks into the odd semester, and the info for auto***** for the even semester is already out
147;2;Your dad and mom are of different religions, your brother is also dating someone from a different religion, and when we were dating, it was the same. Then you said it was because “God is just testing us to see whether we choose people or Him.” Come on… God’s not that rigid, testing His children like that. Everything happens for a reason.

155;1;Guys, the dollar is considered a stable currency because it’s used for payments in many countries. So if all countries stop using the dollar as a payment method, wouldn’t that cause inflation due to excess printing? (And the US wouldn’t be able to just print money recklessly like they do now to pay off their debt.)
156;1;Do you guys ever feel so sad whenever you see someone so pretty, then you know no matter what you wouldn't end up together?
157;2;I just wanna ask, is being in a passive class a blessing or a curse? When the lecturer asks something, no one answers. I’m the type who really respects lecturers, so even if I have no idea, I still try to answer for the sake of appreciation. But what stresses me out is I feel bad, like I’m scared my friends think I’m showing off or trying to be a know-it-all. So… should I be grateful or just complain???
158;2;"You’re comfortable with someone else, happy with someone else, venting to someone else, but the ""situationship"" is with me — so what am I even here for, damn?"

165;2;How many midterms do you guys have left? I’ve got just one more, but I’m sooo not in the mood asdjksf
166;1;Bismillah, submitting one midterm today
167;2;Someone said this earlier. Walked in and went, “Ugh, why does this place smell so bad? Not like campus A****.” Then their friends chimed in too: “Ugh, the table’s so dusty, it sticks to my hands. Why didn’t they clean it before we used it?” I mean, saying stuff like that is fine, but don’t say it right in front of the person managing the room — and so loudly too. I know you’re from that newer campus, but we literally just came in and haven’t even turned the AC on yet.
168;1;If we want to do an internship, we definitely need to make a CV, right? But if we’re not active in campus organizations, will that hurt our chances of getting accepted? Spill the tea please

174;2;Finally moved on from the ex, only to catch feelings for someone of a different religion — DAMN ITTTT
175;1;I’ve fully accepted that maybe I won’t get an internship this 6th semester, and I might have to switch tracks to independent study or research. It’s okay though — I can still apply for internships after I graduate. LET’S GOOO KEEP THE SPIRIT UP!!!
176;0;Hey EPC, do you allow switching tracks?
177;1;Finally, it’s raining again after so long. Please let it last longer so I can be sad in peace + sleep comfortably.
178;2;Just wanna rant. It’s kinda my fault for filling out the PP form carelessly. I didn’t really understand it, so I didn’t join the paid promote. Then suddenly I got fined hundreds of thousands without any warning. Dang, that’s scary.
179;1;How do you even tell someone that you don’t like their attitude — like it totally gives you the ick?
180;1;I’ve got a crush on someone from the same FL committee but we’ve never talked and we’re from different majors. If only you knew...
181;2;Guys, does anyone still have 1 course missing in their schedule? What do you do about that?
182;2;Honestly, UTS could be done fast if you wanted. It’s just me overthinking everything like, “Is this answer even right?”
183;0;I don’t get how some people go to the gym but don’t look like it — especially those who are overweight or obese.
184;1;Come on Binus, if we’re fully onsite already, can we please be allowed to park inside Syahdan?
185;1;Help, my phone won’t charge.
186;2;Honestly, I can’t handle doing two previously combined courses at once anymore... Please don’t do this again, Sunib. This is a waterpark of chaos, man
187;1;During the enrichment period, there are no midterms or finals anymore, right?
188;2;Does anyone know which student clubs are still open for registration??
189;2;I DON’T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING IN THE AOL DATABASE AAAAAAAAAAAA
190;2;Someone please answer — if I didn’t get accepted into enrichment internship, do I have to reapply if I want to switch to independent study?
191;2;Has anyone ever joined a competition during class time? Do you think they’d give attendance leniency?
192;0;HIMME and HIMANDA, let’s collab for an event sometime!
193;2;Hey, just wondering — what do the scholarship mentors at Binus actually do? Is it worth it?
194;0;Anyone who plays Tetris Effect, let’s play together!
195;0;Isn’t it actually better to have exams onsite than online?
196;1;Sunib really loves doing things last minute. I’ve felt it since my very first semester.
197;2;Damn, you’re a master manipulator. Acting all innocent, when at home you’re a total jerk. Your parents support you, your friends are always there for you, you’re always defended, but you say you’re oppressed and admit to using your family? Then you tell your guy I’m the villain? WOW, applause. Just makes me more hyped to leave this country—I seriously hate it here.
198;2;Rising up from being bullied takes a lot of effort and painful experiences. Sometimes the scars never go away. But once you make it through, there’s a deep sense of pride—you become more confident. Let’s rise up, fellow bullying survivors!

201;0;Serious question: Is it okay if I don’t join any student organizations in college?
202;2;My crush often asks me about school stuff. Last time he asked, “Hey, have you finished UTS A yet?” I really want to talk about something more personal with him 😭 but there’s just no opening. Any advice?
203;2;Despite us ending as a wreck, I always wish that one day you’ll find the peace and love within yourself.
204;2;You know, I changed my Line profile picture and posted it as a story just to see if you’d notice—to know if you’ve deleted or blocked me. And turns out, you did see it. I was so happy omg haha.
205;2;Guys, I need your opinion. I usually chat with this guy for work stuff (but I kinda like him too). On the last day, I sent all the work stuff, and the next day he messaged me again, and has kept chatting since. Sometimes he even asks things he could easily find out on his own. Do you think he’s into me too? :”)
206;1;Have you guys never been taught to respect others’ opinions?
207;1;Are the old Bimob and Bimay really no longer accessible?
208;1;To everyone, don’t be provoked by the unwise actions of a few people here. We may have different races, religions, and cultures, but we are all Indonesian citizens. Let’s maintain unity, respect each other, and avoid prejudice.
209;0;Someone replied in the forum, “Thank you, sir, for the material.” Is it okay to just copy and paste that?
210;1;I don’t have a circle of friends in college. Is that normal? I’m just a quiet person.
211;2;It’s been over a year since we broke up, we’ve had no contact and removed each other from second accounts, but honestly, I still miss them :’) I know they weren’t good to me, but I’m just stupid like that.
212;1;If the DHD is marked red, the Zoom link still shows up, right?
213;2;I really hate people who don’t know the full truth but still act like judges 😠 Seriously messed up
214;0;For those who haven’t gotten an internship yet, let’s hope we all hear good news soon
215;1;I miss strolling around the mall on weekends. Zara, Stradivarius, Pull & Bear, H&M... 😭 I miss it so much.
216;1;So tired, I just wanna cry.
217;0;Is Cirebon considered Javanese or Sundanese?
218;0;I want to make myself shorter.
219;2;Multimedia Solution midterm lasts a week, but I only have 3 days to work on it because I don’t have a MacBook. OMAAGAAAA...
220;1;Why is the learning video all black when I play it? Only a few scenes show the lecturer teaching. I thought the video would be clear. I regret enrolling—please help us, God.
221;2;I’m already in my 3rd semester but still don’t have any close friends who really know me inside out… Anyone? I’m not the only one who feels this way, right?
222;2;Anyone got accepted at Telkom? I want to apply there but the job description seems half-hearted, it’s so brief 😭 hard to understand.
223;2;I’m no longer in love (or whatever you call it) with my boyfriend. It’s not because I’m bored or he did something wrong. I just have no feelings at all anymore. I don’t even want to be touched by him. I want to break up, but I don’t know how to say it. Any advice?
224;0;Is there a G20 Madara?
225;1;I don’t get it, why are there suddenly so many assignments right before the holidays
226;1;How can I tell if I really like him? Not just curious or admiring. We rarely meet because of different onsite schedules, and we only talk during group projects
227;1;If the rule is that we can apply for up to 5 internships per 7 days, does that mean it's normal to decline one if we get accepted into more than one? I know it's common, but I'm afraid it'll leave a bad impression… or is it actually fine? I want to apply to more than two places, but I'm also scared of turning one down (if that actually happens). But waiting for each one’s decision individually doesn’t make sense either. Please advise.
228;2;I need advice—what should I do? Lately, I’ve been really suspicious of my boyfriend. I feel like he’s hiding something, but I also hate how I’ve become so distrustful. It feels like I don’t trust him. Help me, guys—what should I do?
229;0;Has anyone here already lost their virginity? If so, why?
230;0;What STEM majors have the most girls in them, bro?
231;0;I took an internship out of boredom, got paid a tiny fee, and even got picked up and dropped off by car. I feel like Livy Renata
232;1;I feel bad for my friend, man. In their Business Statistics LAB class, they were told to make their own questions. LOL
233;0;When does the even (spring) semester start?
234;1;I used to be close to my dad as a kid, but now I only talk to him when I need something. It sucks.
235;2;I’m worried about you… please talk to me if something’s going on 🥺🥺 I feel really uneasy like this…
236;1;Please don’t let COVID end so soon—maybe extend it until my class graduates. I’ve gotten so comfy with online lectures while lying down. I really don’t want to go back to on-site classes.
237;2;Innalillahi wa inna ilaihi roji'un (Indeed, we belong to Allah and to Him we shall return). My condolences for the victims of today’s earthquake in Cianjur. May the deceased be accepted by Allah SWT. Aamiin ya rabbal alamin.
238;1;What motivates people to date someone from a different religion? Like, you already know it won’t work unless one’s willing to convert. Won’t moving on be even harder later?
239;0;Lick my period blood
240;1;Damn, is this auto-debit thing happening every month?
241;1;As Bang TULUS said, “Love comes in many forms.” Maybe mine is shaped like a missile—soaring into the sky, then crashing right into the heart, exploding and destroying all hopes of being with you.
242;1;Instead of stressing over people, let’s just watch something. Right, guys?
243;0;I’m so happy I got asked to eat together by my crush~
244;0;Any info on how to build a portfolio besides bootcamps?
245;1;Why are guys so moody like girls? Sensitive over every little thing. Ew gross.
246;1;Hey guys, I need someone to talk to :(
247;0;It felt kinda good being passed around by 5 guys, got picked up last night at the club
248;1;I have friends but I can’t help feel alone most of the time
249;1;"Tired, but let’s power through ;)"
250;0;Yay or nay unpaid internship?
251;2;Fellow Suncur folks, be brutally honest with me—is it just me being sensitive? My family’s financial situation is really bad… but my dad does have a bottle of expensive wine. Then my friend came over and casually said, “Well, at least your dad has fancy wine, even if he doesn’t invest in land or cars.” I didn’t know how to react. Was that a backhanded comment or am I just extra sensitive? I’ve really been struggling lately.
252;1;We’re supposed to submit our thesis softcover first, but the defense schedule still hasn’t been announced.
253;2;I really love my friend, but every time I’m with her, I end up hating myself more. She often judges people’s bodies and appearances. It’s sad because she’s an old friend and she’s nice to me, but I just can’t unhear the way she talks about others. It makes me more and more insecure and feel like I’m not enough.
254;0;To those quarantining and dieting—please share your diet tips!
255;0;What’s the difference between Asian and European students when it comes to campus activities?
256;0;Hey guys, where do you usually write your internship reports?
257;0;When does the even semester start?
258;1;For those in batch B25/B26, are lab classes allowed to be taken online? If yes, how?
259;0;If I don’t register for courses tomorrow, will there be another chance?
260;1;I still don’t get why there’s auto-debit charges for internships… even though there aren’t any more classes. What’s the logic behind that? Anyone please enlighten me
261;0;Pudingcokelat’s points are going up super fast.
262;1;Even trying to contest exam grades makes you feel like a beggar, damn.
263;1;Quick question—if there’s a bill and I want to request a late payment, who should I contact? TIA (Thanks in advance)
264;1;Guys, it’s already October 13th hehe
265;2;For those who hate on female students wearing makeup to campus—if I want to do full ULTRA COVERAGE makeup early in the morning, that’s my business. You didn’t pay for my powder, right? Whether it’s freshmen or seniors, it’s their right. Remember: everyone has their own preferences. So MIND YOUR OWN F*CKING BUSINESS. THANK YOU. Oh, and I checked out the IG of those who trash-talk makeup-wearing students—no eyebrows. No wonder you’re jealous HAHAHAHA.
266;2;I didn’t realize it’s almost December already!
267;0;Is the Circle K at BSQ open 24 hours?
268;1;When does Binus release the final exam schedule? I wanna make a work timeline ASAP because there are so many finals
269;0;I like you, but I don’t have the courage to say it.
270;2;I think 21 is where I stop... I'm exhausted. Or maybe I should just die, or become some sugar daddy’s side chick? I’m so tired of having to figure everything out myself at this age. My parents are trash—useless.
271;0;Anyone got a jacket that's too small? Mine’s too big—size L. Looking to trade it for a size M.
273;0;Hi everyone, please help us fill out this questionnaire for our project: https://forms.gle/m8JtUNkMES1nBGCo9. For those who aren’t doing internships right now. May God repay your kindness. Thank you
274;1;Why are my friends finishing their midterms so quickly?
275;0;Girls, do you also gossip about the cute guys in your class?
276;0;Guys, do we get to choose our site supervisor freely?
277;0;For real, only the admission staff with initial V at Binus Anggrek has managed to steal my heart out of all the girls at Binus hahaha.

279;0;Good luck to everyone starting their internship tomorrow—wish me luck as well.
280;0;Testing, one two three.
281;0;Sigh, I wished for Hu Tao but ended up getting Keqing instead
282;1;Please refrain from commenting if you’re unsure about the validity of the information. Avoid spreading unverified claims, especially when people are relying on your updates.
283;1;What are the do's and don’ts of befriending an introverted person? I’d like to become friends with this introvert, but I’m unsure how to initiate a conversation.
284;1;We’ve been given the opportunity to apply for internships until early February. Please wish me and my friends—who haven’t secured placements yet—the best of luck.
285;0;What kind of activities are typically conducted during the Binus FYP outbound program?
286;2;It’s difficult having a family that evaluates everything based on physical appearance. Everything is tied to perceived attractiveness. It becomes especially challenging when your partner isn’t conventionally attractive, as they're often unfairly judged. It’s frustrating.
287;2;If we join Community Development, do we still need to find a placement ourselves or not? I’ve chosen Bandung, but I don’t know the exact place yet.
288;1;Everything begins and ends “in bed.” The starting point of it all is “in bed.”
289;2;So… I’ve been getting close to this one guy. It started as FWB, but the way he treated me when we first met was really gentle—and I loved it. But lately, he’s been showing signs that he wants something serious. He’s a playboy, and I’m a player too 💀💀. But with others, we’d usually stop at FWB. He said he wants to change, even if slowly—as long as there’s progress instead of faking 100% and ending up going back. He’s the first guy who really listens and adores me. Should I take him seriously now? What should I do?
290;0;While everyone else is taking finals, I’m rewatching Naruto from the beginning.
291;0;Just finished Itaewon Class, and the ending was so disappointing.
292;1;For those going onsite, stay safe guys—Jakarta’s Omicron cases jumped by 2,000 yesterday.
293;2;So someone said to me that my parent are mean, to me...
294;1;When my Layla lands a free hit, that’s when your hero starts screaming in pain.
295;0;Guys, quick question—when we retake a course (SP), does it affect the GPA of the original semester or the semester when we retake it?
296;2;Hello, with all due respect, I sincerely apologize because this is related to religion... I’m extremely disappointed today—my little sibling was beaten up by kids their age, had their phone smashed, and was screamed at: “YOUR RELIGION ***** YOU’RE BORN IN HELL!!!!” They’re just in 2nd grade and now getting stitches. FYI, I’m from a minority religion, but please… please respect our presence even just a little. I’m seriously emotional—I can’t hold it in anymore. To be honest, I can’t take this treatment anymore. Just yesterday our house was almost burned down by a group of kids, but thankfully some neighbors saw it. The day before, a rock was thrown at our car and shattered the window, and they kept shouting “pork is haram.” FYI, I RARELY EVEN EAT PORK. Okay, let me just say—I’m fed up. I apologize for being a minority. I’m planning to go abroad and take my family with me… happy now?
297;0;What do you think—if your ex wants to stay friends but you’re still hoping for more, is it better to stay friends or go no contact?
298;0;By the way, is it still possible to fill out the health declaration so I can attend online later? I heard from A that it’s possible, but B said you need permission from SSC.
299;2;I just wanna scream “DCK”*
300;2;I wish I were as popular as eheh, I’ve commented so many times and still no one notices me
301;0;Why is Suncur so quiet lately?
302;2;WHERE CAN I FIND A GUY LIKE HAYASE?! I love the way he thinks and expresses his thoughts—like bro you’re seriously so cool! I wish guys like Hayase existed in real life—the type of guy who’s perfect for a deep talk :
303;1;Agns Grcia’s identity is being exposed by netizens—even her past and childhood videos got dug up. I’m imagining if one day I got into trouble and netizens found my past—it’d probably be my Wattpad stories and fandom Twitter accounts getting exposed… and they had tons of followers too
304;1;I’m so bored during this break, let’s chat!
305;2;Is this forum even read one by one? 😭 I’m doing this so halfheartedly, I swear
306;0;Guys, can you tell me your favorite flavors of Indomie or Mie Sedap? I’m restocking and want to try some new ones. Mine: Indomie Rendang, Mie Sedap Ayam Limau.
307;0;HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE SUNCUR USER WHO’S CELEBRATING TODAY!!
308;2;SHIT—if the new semester starts earlier, that means internship starts earlier too—and so will the application deadline?!?!
309;2;Big body (eating up the people’s money), small conscience (no morals), wakes up and (passes nonsensical policies), and the people immediately suffer. DPR, DPR, DPR, that’s what they call it...
310;1;Why did Binusmaya turn into NewsBinusmaya? I was trying to download something from the support menu and now I can’t.
311;2;So tired weee
312;2;Damn Indihome is acting up again—keeps going on and off even though there’s no rain or anything. Ughhh.
313;1;Please, if you want to ask something, at least Google it first
314;1;The older I get, the more alone I feel.
315;1;I really hate it when large classes are mixed with B24—they’re wild, noisy, obnoxious, and worst of all, lack basic manners during chats. (not generalizing, but if you’re offended, maybe you’re part of the group I’m talking about)
316;0;How was your first day of internship?
317;0;
318;1;What kind of horse stance hurts the most?
320;1;That shit hurt i'm so mad right now i don't feel like i'm being appreciated enough
321;0;Introverted guys are actually kinda adorable..
322;1;If my parents don’t approve of my relationship for reasons that aren’t my partner’s fault (like things beyond our control/fate), should I follow what they say or just keep going and try to prove them wrong?
323;0;If my parents don’t approve of my relationship for reasons that aren’t my partner’s fault (like things beyond our control/fate), should I follow what they say or just keep going and try to prove them wrong?
324;2;People who just stand still on the right side of the escalator—can’t read or just don’t care? It’s not hard to follow the rules. Feel bad for those who need to pass but get stuck. If you're not in a rush, it’s not that hard to wait a few more seconds and move to the left. Show that you're an educated person.
325;1;Guys, need your opinion. Better to spend New Year’s at a bar with my girl friends (people I know), or at my boyfriend’s friend’s place (people I don’t know)? The pro of going with my girls: I’ll have company, but going and getting back is kinda tricky. The pro of going to my boyfriend’s: I don’t have to worry about transport, but I don’t know anyone there.
326;0;Hi, let’s be friends! Drop your IG in my DMs and I’ll follow—just don’t forget to follow back hehe
327;0;Merry Christmast all.
328;1;How come that person eats a lot but never gains weight? Meanwhile I drink water and gain 1kg, huhu
329;1;Guys, any tips on how to get rid of acne scars?
330;2;I go to the same church as him. I’m in marketing comm at Kemanggisan, he’s computer science in Alsut. We’ve been friends since around 2017-2018. I don’t know if he knows I like him or not. We’re not super close, but whenever we meet and chat, we really connect, and I feel so comfortable with him. Honestly, sometimes I get the feeling he likes me too because of how he acts, but sometimes it’s a no. He gives off mixed signals and I hate that. Or maybe he’s just interested as a friend, HEHEHEH. Oh well. Hopefully he doesn’t see this HAHAHA 🤮. That’s all, just wanted to vent. Thanks
331;0;Happy Valentine’s Day—hopefully no more clowning around next year!
332;1;How do you socialize at Binus?
333;1;It must be nice to have a moodbooster when you're feeling down.
334;0;Guys, which stock mutual fund has good prospects on Bibit for long-term investment?
335;0;Morning class after midterms, got jumpscared by the Zoom speaker sounding like “Kijang 1 ganti.” Those online were ignored and it was super quiet for us online, lol.
336;0;Most student organizations I see at Sunib barely have committee members from regions other than Senayan, Kemanggisan, or Alsut. Just wondering why, considering these orgs exist in all regions. No offense, just curious. Thanks!
337;0;Start from being friends - best friends - lover. Imagine it was that easy
338;2;What’s the point of me applying for Malang if I just end up being sent to Kemanggisan and getting tossed around everywhere? This is BS.
339;2;How do I cut off a friend who's insanely FOMO? Honestly, this friendship is draining—both financially and mentally.
340;0;B23 batch who’s continuing to semester 9, sound off hereee!
341;1;I wish people appreciated me more.
342;1;To the Rector Cup 2022 Valorant committee—your scheduling is a mess. You knew we had morning classes but still insisted on scheduling the games then, even after so many complaints from participants.
343;1;They said the proskrip announcement would be on the 21st, but it’s the 23rd and there’s still nothing 😀
344;0;Better to be single than be in a relationship that makes you angry every day. Am I right?
345;2;I think I'm slick but the reality is I'm fucking stupid
346;0;Anyone here applied for the My Digital Academy Program?
347;2;I’m bored of this world. I wish I were given a quest to hunt for treasure, explore valleys and caves out there, find adventure buddies, slay dragons, and rescue princesses.
349;0;I’m really curious… how do people even fall in love online?? Like, how do you even start catching feelings? Tell me, I wanna know!
350;0;Anyone here play PKXD?
351;2;Bro RMCS is wild. Each person has to find 9 papers, and each group of 5 can’t use the same ones?? That’s literally 45 DIFFERENT papers. Like, we got other midterms too, ya know??
352;2;My mental's wrecked from the Intro to Accounting final. The exam had zero mercy
353;2;Damn should I just get on birth control so I stop having periods? It's such a pain fr.
354;2;Back then we were basically romusha... worked like horses every damn day...
355;0;I’m torn—should I keep going with college or switch to a bootcamp? After one semester, it just feels way too general. I wanna go straight into career stuff... but damn, the tuition’s already been paid
356;1;Wanna ask her out, but I only got a motorbike… what if she doesn’t like broke dudes like me
357;1;I’m dead tired from the gym and I still don’t look like a PON bodybuilder
358;0;Hey! May I start over?
359;1;Bro I’m dying—filled in question 7, then went ahead and filled 24 again like it’s brand new
360;1;Guys so like… if it’s full onsite now, can we still request to do online for over a month? Covid’s still all over the place…
361;1;Hey guys just wondering—if we land an internship at a good company through internship apps, is that like, Binus privilege or is it actually something we can be proud of ourselves?
362;1;Things really have changed. Now it’s all sensitive vibes. Can’t even joke around like we used to.
363;1;What do we need for onsite finals besides a Flazz card and stationery??
364;0;“Why was I even born?” That’s the question people always ask. But the real question is… why continue?
365;0;I’m curious—how many hours do you guys sleep these days? I’m stuck on like 5–6 hours a night.
366;1;I used to wonder why people stayed out late and got clowned like “damn, you live outside or what?”—but now I get it. And the ones who stay home all the time? Probably wanna go out too, but can’t. They’re avoiding problems, even though problems still find them anyway.
367;0;Got myself a goofy girl—and I love her
368;1;First time in my life I’m jealous of a dog. Hank… you lucky dog
370;2;Ever just wanna kick a friend outta your life 'cause their bad vibes are messin’ with your peace?
371;1;Rumor has it the onsite/online schedule’s gonna change again after midterms… that true? Heard it from Male, 24—any updates from LSC/SSC?
372;1;Ever have someone say “I’ll do it now” but they’re just chillin’ on IG instead?? Kinda annoying ngl
373;0;Lost my student ID—do I have to sort it out at Anggrek or can I do it in Bekasi too?
375;1;Anyone selling SAT prep books… or like… the SAT itself?
376;2;Lately I’ve been reading old chats with my ex… and honestly it hurts. I really gave it my all. She forgot everything the moment we broke up. I made time for her even while juggling college and work—but when I needed her? She left. Cheated. It stings :) Now I just sit in my room, thinking “no one’s ever gonna love me the way I love them.”
377;1;Hey guys, where do we register for PAPB for graduation? Anyone got the info? Wanna sign up for the next one—I wanna experience it too
378;2;Hey everyone… just finished cooking, the kids are asleep… so I’ll just say this—felt kinda sad seeing my husband’s IG recent searches full of girls… but oh well. Gotta get up early tomorrow anyway. Sleep it off, I guess.
379;2;So I like this girl right, and I told my friend. They wanted to know what kinda girl I’m into, so I showed our chats. And they went, “ugh you’re getting all soft over that? Noob. Weak.” Now I’m wondering… do I even deserve to like her? She’s been pretty close to me, but I’m not good-looking, not smart like my friend either. Should I just back off?
380;1;I spent 3 full days grinding for one midterm, then I see my friend casually finish it like it’s nothing… why am I lowkey jealous
381;0;The sky doesn’t need to explain that it’s high.
382;1;Do you all miss Rocky or is it just me?
383;1;Dude, I just talked to someone on LinkedIn… and I honestly feel like an empty barrel. Like “what have I even been learning all this time?”
384;0;anay poke marain maripob dupop a a a
385;1;Sooo bored, any K-drama recommendations? Kinda in the mood for something sad.
386;1;So annoying when people say “Excuse me, you haven’t shared your screen, we can’t see it yet” and the reply is “I don’t want to share my screen actually!!”
387;1;Guys should I buy the shoes I really like VS the ones that are just okay but I know I’ll wear a lot (easier to mix and match)?
388;2;USELESS GROUP FUCK THIS SHIT
389;0;If anyone needs a service for ATS-friendly CVs or Java, PHP, C/C++ coding, reply below and I’ll give you the contact info.
390;1;What should we do to people who love destroying others’ expectations?
391;1;Hope this time I end up with someone from UBM
392;2;I like a girl who already has a boyfriend. Should I go for it or nah?? Do you think I’d have a chance??
393;0;Finals are over, time to fix my sleep schedule.
394;0;Just a reminder to y’all — soon you’ll be surrounded by people with no shame asking for answers. Ignore them and don’t give in, lol. And for those of you who are those shameless people — I hope you gain some self-awareness real soon.
395;1;Has anyone ever been online for more than 2 months straight?
396;1;Can you really trust a player when he says he wants to commit to one girl?
397;1;Anyone know how to enter the department room on Teams? I didn’t even know there was one until I was asking a friend about BIFEST info and they said it’s been there forever. Btw I’m a freshman
398;1;I’m curious about this one guy. I wanna talk to him but I’m too shy and insecure.
399;1;Schools these days have marriage practice now?! Back in my day we only practiced how to shroud a corpse and do funeral prayers
400;1;My crush is mean as hell — won’t even follow me back
401;1;Hey guys, how long does it take to make a Flazz card at Binus? And how much does it cost? I have no idea where mine went.
402;1;For collective leave days like today… do lecturers get the day off too? I wanna ask about internships but don’t wanna bother them.
403;0;For the guys out there — would you still go for a pretty girl if her attitude sucks? Just ‘cause she’s pretty?
404;1;This guy started getting close to me, and it felt nice to have someone to talk to. But now it feels too good to be true — like he’s perfect in every way (at least for me). And now I’m just insecure because he seems too high quality.
405;2;Why is this happening. I always attend VC, onsite, and GSLC classes, but my attendance for VC says absent. Now four of my courses are marked “not eligible” for exams. I’ve contacted LSC but they’re super slow to respond. What should I dooo?

407;0;Guys, got any good movie recs from 2023?
408;1;My little sibling wants to start dating, but I’m torn. They’re in college now, but I still feel like they’re not mature enough yet.
409;2;For those who are feeling hopeless, exhausted, fed up with assignments, crappy groupmates, or stressed about not getting internship approval — just stay hopeless and don’t be motivated, guys. Maybe go ahead and plan a revolution or something dramatic instead.
410;1;We used to be so close, and now it’s like we’re complete strangers
411;2;I’ve got zero appetite lately, bro… my weight suddenly dropped like crazy
412;1;Why is it that every time I try to get close to a girl, it never works out? They always pull away, man
413;0;Hey guys, has anyone here ever worked as a barista? If you have, please share your experience hehe I wanna apply but I’ve never made coffee before
414;2;I DON’T HAVE A MACBOOK, I LITERALLY CAN’T DO THIS EXAM AT ALL. Why the hell does GAT have to include Mobile Multimedia Solution?! This campus is so unfair, they should give us software options for Windows/Linux too
415;2;my guilt won’t eat me up. the soul it fed on.. she’d been gone for a long time.
416;1;For those of you who got accepted for internships — does the status on the website show “awaiting” or not?
417;1;Oh Lord, I love her, I care about her, I miss her… but she doesn’t feel the same aaa
418;1;Can you please postpone or reduce the tuition payment? My parents are struggling since their business got hit hard by COVID, we’re broke
419;1;I wanna say it… but I just can’t
420;0;If you can guess who I am, I’ll treat you to boba 🤭 happy guessing 🤪 *tag me in the comments if you figure it out hihihi (limited slots) hint: I posted a Binus twibbon LOL *good luck hunting
421;0;Who’s that person everyone calls something with “nang” in the hallway? You’re seriously cute, btw. Cut down on the smokes, curlyhead. Love u
422;0;Do you guys usually sit in the same spot on campus or switch it up sometimes?
423;1;"Who is ""anakhukum17"" tho??? I keep seeing that name everywhere and now I’m really curious…"
424;2;My parents didn’t let me be an artist and now look at me… single af. Never even got to hang out or get close to girls I liked. If I were a celeb… it’d be so much easier to get close to girls — both public figures and normal folks
425;0;It’d be dope if someone breaks through
426;1;Don’t wanna go full on-site ‘cause COVID cases are rising? But you’re still out here hanging out, going places, and watching movies? Like… seriously?
427;0;This friend of mine wants to get into Sunib, I told them to just go for BOL instead lol
428;2;The older I get, the more I realize — I don’t care how fancy the office is, if the pay is trash, I’d rather start my own small biz that brings in 2-digit income, fr fr
429;1;So my friend’s being kinda toxic ‘cause of Instagram. In your opinion, what does IG toxicity look like? I’m still not getting what part of it is toxic. Thanks to anyone who wants to explain
430;1;If a freshman asks you out, should you go or nah? I’m kinda torn
431;1;Guys, what’s regular class usually used for? Why do we keep using creative class instead?
432;1;Come on, spill your stories — Suncur’s way too quiet right now
433;1;So freaking tired of getting ignored every time I talk in the group. Don’t y’all want good grades or what?
434;2;Others feel like they picked the wrong major, but me? I feel like I chose the wrong specialization. Doing exams feels like such a heavy burden
435;0;Seniors, quick question — does Sunib have a thesis proposal (sempro) stage?
436;2;I just did my research exam last week… and I just realized I forgot to include the Turnitin result. Now I’m super stressed, seriously. I might fail just because of a dumb mistake like this
437;0;Best feeling ever is walking into H*rm*s or D**r wearing just flip-flops, a plain t-shirt, and shorts — and the sales assistant still knows you lol
438;0;Anyone here taking the thesis via scientific article track this odd semester?
439;2;I’m from Lampung and lately I’ve been getting bullied — they say Lampung people are incompetent, just because Jokowi had to take over fixing our roads. Please don’t generalize. Not all of us are like that. That road issue is on the local government, not us ordinary folks. It hurts to see Lampung people getting bullied like this… please stop :(
440;1;Been crushing on someone for 7 years and they still haven’t caught on
441;1;Been crushing on someone for 7 years and they still haven’t caught on
442;1;Guys, quick q — has anyone ever requested a make-up exam? Do we have to pay for that?
443;2;First day of internship and I already had 3 meetings with the boss… I was so tired I accidentally dozed off during one of them
444;1;Why is Alsut so packed today?
445;0;Craving ice cream right now
446;0;When you open Suncur, are you the type to check notifs first or read people’s posts first?
447;1;Tried making that viral garlic fried chicken, but just before frying it I suddenly felt full/nauseous — even though I hadn’t eaten anything yet. I’ll just save it for dinner :,)
448;1;Still doing assignments even though my soul is crumbling inside
449;0;Wait… turns out humans only breathe from one nostril at a time?
450;1;I wanna try doing my thesis as a scientific article, but I’m scared I won’t be able to match the publisher’s timeline (either too long or too fast) with my thesis defense
451;0;Hello there, Mr/Ms. “Suddenly got a boyfriend/girlfriend”
452;0;I'm grateful having you in my life
453;1;I’ve only finished 1 midterm so far… how about you guys?
455;1;Gonna vent real quick — I’m juggling my own business while studying. On one hand, I’m super grateful for the opportunity, but at the same time I feel super overwhelmed. Got any time management tips? I’m the type who always does stuff last minute (I know, that’s on me 😅)

457;1;Guys, is it true that once you unapply from Binus Intern, you can’t apply again?
458;0;Anyone got a Discord or WhatsApp group for SOCS? If yes, can I join?
459;1;Why do girls say they don’t like guys who smoke… but it’s fine if the guy’s hot?
460;2;Hi, God. It’s me again. Nothing much besides things between me and this guy that i’m seeing is pretty complicated right now. But you already know that obviously hehe. If he’s not good for me, please make him good for me. If it turns out that i’m bad for him, then make me good for him. But in the end if we’re bad for each other, then please just let us go separate ways. Thank you
461;1;Finally got the chance to talk to my crush, but I acted all cold. I swear I turn into a nervous wreck whenever we get close
462;1;Anyone else in the Kebon Jeruk area having a blackout too??
463;0;Because we do all our assignments on laptops now, when I had to handwrite something, I low-key forgot how to use a pen
464;1;Been working on the group project, always joining meetings, even helping with the Google Docs — but still labeled as “inactive.” Like bruh, I just want it done and submitted fast. Pffffft
465;2;You liked me, I liked you too, but you chose someone else because you knew I was deeply hurt — hoping you’d still end up with me in the end. But we ended up fighting, ruining everything. Now I’m the only one who remembers. Have you forgotten those feelings too? Since then, I’ve stopped expecting anything, my feelings faded. But then you came back, like something new. I feel empty now, so I just act normal. I don’t know if those old feelings can come back.
466;0;Why are the IT guys at Binus all so handsome?
467;0;How long does it usually take for grade protest results to come out, guys?
468;0;To that Binusian 2020 kid from Sasjep… I miss you :)
469;1;For those of you who ride motorbikes — please don’t lock your handlebar if there’s a bike in front of you. People can’t get their bikes out when yours is blocking the way. Be considerate
470;1;I swear I’m so sick of people who box girls into “can’t do this, can’t do that,” while guys can do whatever they want! Go live in the stone age if that’s your vibe
471;0;Anyone wanna be friends? I’m from KMG Anggrek
472;0;Drop some tips for making friends online please. Been stuck behind MBB for 3 semesters.
473;1;I just find it kinda funny how my friend used to say “hard skills aren’t important, only soft skills matter” since day one (he’s not really into studying tbh). Now that it’s internship season, he suddenly stopped saying that—guess he realized most internships need you to actually know A, B, C skills 😬. I mean, soft skills are important, but don’t say hard skills are useless just because you hate studying. Like… how are you gonna show off your soft skills if you don’t even get called for interviews? 😌 Anyway, good luck everyone—hope you land your dream internship!
474;0;Is LKC open this Sunday?
475;0;"Anyone know how to choose delivery mode? Based on the ""Onsite Class Rules"" banner on Bimay’s site, it says if you’re eligible for DHD, you can still choose between F2F or online."
476;0;Survey says Binus students attend webinars more than any other uni 😂 Anyone know why? YTTA
477;1;Be gone, manipulative men
478;0;Can anyone drop the registration link for FL/FP this year? Thank youuu
479;0;Netflix Indonesia trending list? All K-Dramas
480;0;Do y’all think hybrid classes should stick around in the future? I mean, they’re super helpful when you’re not feeling well but don’t wanna waste an absence. Or when the lecturer’s out of town and just does a Zoom class instead. Also great for people outside Jakarta who still want to study at Binus (not OL program, since the accreditation’s different).
481;2;I used to be suuuper positive. No matter what happened, I always looked on the bright side. But then I realized people were just using me. And whenever I spoke up or complained, they’d say I had a “loser attitude”
482;1;Is it too late to transfer unis in semester 3? I’m honestly struggling—no study buddies, no motivation, just stress all the time.
483;1;Has anyone done an onsite midterm or final for Algoprog? Do they really make you code on paper??
484;1;It’s only the start of 2023, but I already feel super lonely...
485;0;If duolingo teaches na’vi i might consider login in
486;2;Guys… I’ve got a crush on my own friend. I wanna confess but I’m scared it’ll get awkward… But if I don’t, I’ll just keep falling harder and become more delulu
487;1;Who here checks internship portals every single day but still doesn’t apply
488;2;Why do parents ALWAYS ask “who is that?” whenever you show them a funny meme or video. IDK MOM IDK WHO THEY ARE
489;0;Hi Binusians, anyone want to buy DWP tickets? I’ve got 2 GA 3-day passes—already wristbands. Can COD at JIEXPO. Maybe SunibCurhat can help post this on IG? I’ll DM whoever’s interested in the comments.
490;1;Guys, for those who’ve had onsite exams—can you drop in the comments how the exam system works?
491;0;Are you choose Japanese or Korean movie?
492;0;Is it hard to make friends at Binus Alsut? Btw I’m B24!
493;0;...............
494;2;Been crushing on this guy for almost 8 years now, confessed more than 3 times… I thought I moved on a few months ago, but yesterday I checked his socials and found out he’s in a committed relationship now. And yep… still hurts. LOL but not really
495;1;How do you deal with people who get pissed at you just because your opinion doesn’t match theirs? Like bro, why you mad just ‘cause we don’t agree??
496;2;"Tired of dating a guy who’s turning 25 this year but still won’t talk about the future. Like we’ve never even had a deep talk. Everything’s just ""go with the flow"". No job, no savings, just gaming all the time. I’m a girl, I need clarity. I’m saving up on my own, fighting on my own… Meanwhile he’s out here living in Neverland"
497;1;I fell asleep next to my girl bestie at her apartment last night.  She lives alone ‘cause she’s out-of-town, and my parents didn’t even check on me. Is that normal??
498;2;I wanna open up about how I’m really doing, but I’ve already become “that happy, chill, outgoing person” for everyone. Now I’m just burnt out. Faking smiles during Zooms, forcing happy voices on DC. It’s exhausting. I miss being that version of me who didn’t care about what others thought—who actually loved herself.
499;2;WHY DID MY SUNCUR POINTS DROP???
500;1;If one day you have your own little family, and your parents are still alive but often sick and have no one to take care of them—please, please take time to be there for them. I know you’re head over heels for your wife and believe every word she says, but she keeps twisting the truth. Don’t forget your parents and your family.
501;1;Sorry guys if I complain a lot
502;1;Girls, can I ask something? How do you regulate your period? It’s been over 6 months since I last got mine...
503;2;I’m SO annoyed at this groupmate who did absolutely nothing. We were in the middle of discussing the actual task and schedule in the group chat, and this one dude just suddenly copy-pasted the instruction from the PDF, translated it using Google Translate, and was like “Done! I worked!” like do you think we can’t read English or what??? And then when it was time to split the work, he refused ‘cause “he already did something” (aka translating the instructions). HOW is someone like that even a college student?!
504;1;Ughhh now they’re using anime couple pics… not this again
505;1;Wow okay miss popular, acting all high and mighty just ‘cause you’re famous among our batch
506;2;#CALLINGOUTLOUD Just gonna use initials here… TO YOU, CHIKA… JUST KEEP CHEATING THEN, HOW LONG YOU GONNA KEEP TAKING OTHER PEOPLE’S BOYFRIENDS??? KARMA’S COMING FOR YOU GIRL… INDOSIAR STYLE. JUST. YOU. WAIT.
507;2;Hey guys! Anyone know how I can sync my schedule to my calendar? Thanks in advance!
508;1;Anyone ever tried tanning or getting darker skin on purpose? Got any tips for that glowy bronze look—not the burnt kind? I really wanna tan ‘cause it just looks so good
509;1;If I wanna go to Alsut, should I take the busway or train? Or is there a better way?
510;0;Watching Thai series for a bit kinda helps keep my mental in check :)
511;0;Is there anyone left who doesn’t use Wi-Fi these days? Feels like internet and gadgets are basically basic needs now lol
512;0;I’m gonna confess next week, wish me luck lol
514;1;Can’t imagine algoprog being onsite, I already flopped online. Stay strong, juniors
515;0;Looks like there’s a new romantic move for people with big bikes like an Xmax—putting the girl (supposedly your gf) right in front where the gas tank is. Kinda reminds me of kids back in the village riding bikes with their friends sitting in front. Is that the kind of thing that makes girls go, “Omg I look so cute like this” or “Aww, cutee”?
516;1;Please stay calm—this life is a test. Literally.
517;1;I seriously don’t know how to say no when people ask for help. But when I do, the guilt just haunts me nonstop!
518;2;So stressed doing thesis and internship at the same time. Wish the internship actually got what I’m going through
519;2;The most “ugh” moment ever: I did my SOCS1 assignment, got the right output, and still got a red mark
520;2;My Valentine’s motto this year is reduce, reuse, recycle—so I just re-gifted the chocolates I got. Didn’t spend a dime on chocolate, baby
521;2;Binus, please don’t give all the deadlines at once. I’m scared I’ll upload the wrong assignment!
523;0;Those who act all humble but are actually arrogant—may every day be a Monday for them. And don’t give them shortcuts, they’ll just get cocky like this
524;1;How did I even catch feelings for a senior I’ve never met??
525;2;My boyfriend’s mom wants both of us to work in the US. I said I’d have to pay with my own money, and he’s like, “Then I won’t go either. No point if you’re not there. We can earn money here too—as long as we’re together.” I mean, US jobs pay well, but he chose me over that… ugh now I’m soft and emotional
526;1;Why haven’t my midterm grades come out yet?? They said it’d be out by Dec 9
527;1;If a guy gets asked his target age for marriage and he says he doesn’t know—do you guys think that’s normal??
528;1;I thought being older meant taking responsibility. But nope—dude just bailed. And he’s the leader too… like, seriously??
529;1;Binus actually gave us some leniency, but I just made things harder for myself. I knew there was a thesis route based on journal publication, but nope—I went with the regular one instead
530;1;"Just opened Binus Intern for the first time and… why is there no ""apply"" button on mine? How am I supposed to apply?? Is mine broken or what?"
531;2;Guys, I swear I’m never going back to Malang. I went to a café, and someone forced me to wear a hijab and gave me an impromptu sermon. People around even backed them up. I just left. Gonna graduate and leave for good. Bye Malang—may all the bigots get fast-tracked to hell.
532;1;Ughh tomorrow’s straight-up onsite already
533;1;Why do guys always lie about “I fell asleep”? Tell me why
534;1;When does the Kampus Merdeka internship open? It’s still not up yet. Anyone got any info?
535;2;Tired of taking psych tests every time I apply for a job. Is it really that important? My dad even said in other countries people just look at your skills, not brain puzzles like these. I mean, I get it but still—tiring when you get rejected and don’t even move to the next step. It sucks that smart and skilled people with lots of experience don’t pass just 'cause of that test. Don't judge a book by its cover, seriously. Big respect to companies who hire without psych tests. My cousin’s company did that! When he asked, “Is the next step the psych test?” the HR guy went, “Nah, that’s outdated. We go straight to practice. You start Monday, 3-month probation.” Like, wow.
536;1;Guys, UAJY kids are gonna be online again next semester how are we holding up lol
537;1;If you’re repeating a semester, does that mean you won’t have any classes during that time? I'm retaking one so… am I just gonna be unemployed for a whole semester or what?
538;0;Let’s get to know each other
539;0;Hey, the person who wore the pink H&M hoodie at LKC Anggrek the other day—let’s be friends!
540;2;Guys seriously need help broke af rn—any good part-time/freelance gigs you can recommend?
541;1;“One circle one goal”—whose slogan is that? Wait... did I mess it up?
542;1;What do you do on your first day of internship? Do you just go sit at your desk right away? I didn’t go through the app, so I’m kinda freestyling it here.
543;0;What’s going on Japan?? You lost to a country younger than my mom
544;2;YOU GOT THIS 3 on-site finals, let’s goo
545;1;Sometimes I just wanna talk for a minute, but I can’t bring myself to call… 'cause I know your heart’s not in it anymore. Whatever we had is gone.
546;1;Got kicked out by my own best friend? Whatever. I can solo this. Not ‘cause I’m antisocial, just done with two-faced people.
547;1;To the guy who said ghosting was just a “test” to see if we care—no. Just no. When you ghost us, we don’t think it’s a test, we think you’re bored or just playing. So stop. It’s dumb and doesn’t work.
548;2;So I had a meeting earlier with my boss and the head of A. Just us three, and I was the only girl. They started joking around about sensitive stuff. One said, “She could be my second wife,” and the other was like, “Only if you’re willing to pay her,” while pointing at me. Then he asked, “How much? $5,000? Indo girls would say yes if paid,” and I just laughed nervously. But after the meeting, it really hit me—this was so inappropriate. It got worse. My boss can’t speak Indo, so the other guy talked trash in Indo and then translated it to him in English, even miming a gross sex act. They joked about my looks and said they only recruited me ‘cause of my face and body. Told my boyfriend and he straight up said: RESIGN. It’s only my second week but yeah… this is straight-up verbal sexual harassment.
549;1;Genuine question: do guys just not like calling? Not gonna lie, my fingers hurt from all the typing every night
550;2;I’m falling in love with my best friend... who’s single... while I already have a girlfriend. Help. I’m so sorry, babe. What do I do??
551;1;Been a uni student for a month and just got accepted into PPTI BCA for next year. Honestly torn—do I continue in BINUS or take the offer? Already paid a lot for my current major (SOCS but not compsci).
552;0;My only motivation to do assignments/exams: remembering how much I pay for tuition
553;0;Friends, please recommend some short-sleeve basic shirts with flowy fabric and lots of color options—especially soft/dusty pink. Preferably under 150k and not oversized. Thank youuu!
554;1;Please BINUS, once we're back to full onsite classes, can we please park inside the Syahdan campus?
555;2;Seriously, I need to vent… I’ve been holding this in for four years. So, I used to date this guy named Kristo. We met at church in 2015 and started dating in early 2017. Everything was going great—no drama at all. We went to church together, studied, did good things as a couple. Then this girl Feli suddenly appeared. She got close to both me and Kristo, and by mid-2018, we considered her a friend. But then Feli started acting shady—she’d randomly threaten me. I kept asking her, “What’s wrong, Li? Did I do something to you?” But all she ever said was that I’m a ‘bitch’. Then at the end of 2018, out of nowhere, my entire high school friend group turned on me without any clear reason. I tried to stay positive, thinking maybe it was just stress or pressure. But Kristo started acting distant too, and by early 2019 he broke up with me—no explanation. I was a mess during exams and tryouts. I even had suicidal thoughts, but instead of acting on them, I turned to church. After the final exams, something awful happened—I was raped by a basketball player from my school. He pulled my hair, forced himself on me… I cried and begged for help. I told my parents, but the guy came from a powerful family, so nothing happened. I started getting harassed by random people even though I hadn’t done anything. Feeling cornered, I went to church, where I met my friend Andi. He told me to seek help from someone trustworthy and powerful—let’s call him Y. Y protected me from further harassment. During the post-exam break, he introduced me to his circle, and for once, I felt safe and at peace. He even introduced me to his girlfriend, who was quite popular. But right before graduation, Y was devastated because his girlfriend broke up with him after being falsely accused. He was completely down and drained. After graduation, Feli started trying to get close to me again, acting like nothing happened. Wanting to move on, I changed my social media accounts and cut ties with my high school peers. Then this month, in 2022, Y found out the breakup was all Feli’s doing. She had lied to his girlfriend, just like she lied about me. Turns out, the guy who raped me… was sent by Feli. She orchestrated everything—just to win over Kristo. Apparently, even back when I was still dating Kristo, she had been spreading lies that I had mental issues, was hospitalized, and more. She even made fake accounts to impersonate me and message people, making it seem like I was the one being problematic. And when she wanted Y to break up with his girlfriend, she made it look like I was dating Y to justify the breakup. Now I feel conflicted. I had finally made peace with the past, but now I feel guilty toward Y and all the others affected. What should I do, guys? Feli and Kristo are still together, and they always avoid me whenever I try to meet them. I really want to ask Feli why she did all this. If she just didn’t like me and wanted Kristo, she could’ve just taken him—no need to destroy so many lives. Thanks for reading my story… sorry it’s so long
556;0;Can anyone recommend a laptop for both college and work that's still budget-friendly?
557;0;Quick question—any good places around Binus Anggrek to shoot video assignments?
558;1;Hey, can you please talk to me not just when you need help with assignments?
559;1;What’s up with the SPTJM, I’m literally crying. I hope it’s ready by tomorrow—the Kampus Merdeka deadline’s coming up
560;1;Ugh I’m starting to worry—how am I gonna get a job with zero organizational experience? lol
561;1;Hey guys, quick question. On the Binus internship app, if it says something like 1 (1), does that mean it’s full? And if it says 2 (5), does that mean 2 slots are taken out of 5? If so, then why are options like 2(2) or 1(1) still showing on the Binus enrichment app?
562;1;Honestly, I love spotting Mercedes on the road—especially the white C300. WHY? Because the lights are amazing, the windows are super tinted (hello privacy!), and I’ve always wanted a car with dark windows. Plus, I’ve noticed Mercedes drivers rarely honk, they keep their distance, and they drive calmly. To me, that shows patience and elegance—like they have both financial and emotional class. I’ve never seen a Merc driver shouting on the street like a savage. They even give way to other cars in a rush. Please pray I can own a Merc someday, guys
563;2;YOU DESERVE BETTER GIRL, KEEP YOUR HEAD UP
564;0;Where can I legally watch Keramat 1 and 2, guys?
565;2;I really wanna watch Dr. Strange, but I don’t know who to go with.
566;1;Your mindset is toxic and greedy. Hope you realize it soon.
567;0;Anyone here subscribed to parking at Alsut mall? How much is it and how does the system work?
568;0;If I join independent comserv, are there any rules or requirements? Like doing neighborhood clean-ups or something? Let me know, guys.
569;1;my shampoo and conditioner ran out at the same time..
570;1;LMAO these aunties keep asking about my salary nonstop. I swear I’m this close to snapping. So nosy! Like, if it’s not enough, are you gonna chip in or what, sis?
571;0;I grant you three wishes, fellow Binusian: to be rich, to get days off, and to graduate.
572;1;So if we unapply a company in the enrichment app, does that mean we can’t apply to it again?
573;2;I just wanna go back to campus ASAP. I can’t take being at home anymore. Feels like I’m the bad guy all the time, every day there’s some argument. The longer I stay home, the more I feel like I’m not worthy of being loved by anyone…
574;2;Is it wrong for me to be harsh with them sometimes? I mean, they’ve hurt me for so long and I’ve been patient all this time.
575;1;I kinda wanted to talk to you (the girl who was smoking at the BINUS dorm canteen earlier), you were wearing a black cap, but I didn’t have the guts 'cause it was kinda crowded there.
576;0;Wait what, how is it already midterms??
577;0;I miss Mitsuha.
578;1;The hardest part of leaving you is, filling the void that you used to fill.
579;0;So lucky to have a lecturer who teaches a super complex logic-heavy subject, but explains it patiently and clearly. Just need to practice more so I don’t freeze up
580;1;Turns out washing your face, brushing your teeth, and wearing lipstick makes people think you’ve showered lol. I thought it wouldn’t matter 'cause my laptop cam’s so blurry anyway.
581;1;Forgive me for the slip-up earlier hehe. Carry on.
583;0;What do you guys think? What kind of attitude does someone with a “rich mentality” have?
584;1;Thought we were true friends, turns out it’s just a clique thing. Honestly glad I don’t have to see them in class anymore lol.
585;0;Need recommendations for girls’ boarding houses in Malang, anyone?
586;1;I miss offline classes back in the early semesters before COVID. It was fun, so much drama and excitement. The more semesters pass, the more going to campus just feels… empty. I used to be excited meeting new people in the beginning, but now it’s just meh.
587;2;I FAILED THE BEELINGUA EXAM—turns out you only get ONE try?? OMG I didn’t read that… Anyone know how much the re-exam costs???
588;2;Failing isn’t always a bad thing. I used to be super introverted, but after forcing myself to be a lab assistant, now I’m totally shameless give it a try lol
589;1;Losing the glory days of our parents is a real thing.
590;2;Has anyone at SUNIB ever been invited into a cult or some weird satanic stuff? Like maybe through a “bible club” as the gimmick?
591;1;During hybrid, the road to BINUS is already packed and hella jammed. What’s it gonna be like when we’re fully onsite? Damn.

600;1;I have a boyfriend but he skips prayers a lot. I mean, I don’t even need him to be super religious or anything, but at least pray consistently, y’know? I get turned off easily by guys who don’t pray. Any advice on how to talk to him about it, guys?
601;1;Today (Feb 8) the BINUS booth at IIETE was packed with MAT demos using VR and AR. Looks like more freshmen are choosing MAT. Hope there’s still room left for GAT students too.

604;0;Hey B23 folks, welcome to this world full of temptations~
605;0;Still out here patiently waiting for all my final exam grades to drop...
606;1;Honestly, I get scared every time I hear loud footsteps on the floor. My heart just starts racing. Am I traumatized or something?
607;0;Is New Bimay down right now?
608;1;If you were me, where would you go? BBQ party with my fam but it’s basically just me and my sibling ‘cause my mom won’t stay up late. Or go hang with my boyfriend’s family for their new house celebration—it’s gonna be way more fun and lively. Help me decide :))
609;0;Aiya Susanti....
610;1;Someone who’s been fighting for 5 months to win their heart gets defeated by someone new they just met for a day who didn’t even try—but they’re attractive. Pain, bro. Pure pain.
611;0;Come on friends, let’s study hard and show our devotion. Boost development! With teamwork and harmony, we shall all thrive together!
612;0;If the BINUS Alam Sutera canteen is closed, where do y’all usually grab food?
613;2;LEE JUNHO WHY ARE YOU A FICTIONAL CHARACTER AAAAAAAA
614;1;Anyone here have parents with different religions? How do you convince them (about anything)?
615;2;DISGUSTING!!! You beat someone up ‘til they’re bruised and then apologize like garbage. You’re trash—no, even trash is better than you. You’re actual sht.*
616;1;i may have failed but i have loved you from the start
617;1;Stress-eating is seriously dangerous.
618;0;If we choose internship for enrichment, will there also be onsite classes? Or just the internship?
619;1;I wanna go out and have fun, but my body just wants to sleep all the time
620;1;This is what life feels like without a vehicle. Pain.
621;1;Why the heck is New Bimay not working right now??
622;2;What do you guys think if someone in the group (let’s call them A) is seen as too perfectionist, and they ask people to work on the group project earlier even though the deadline is still far? A is mad because their work gets constantly corrected for not matching the brief, and now people think A is too picky and demanding. But the “perfectionist” just wants to secure good grades since their exams were bad, and wants to work in advance so they don’t rush later. They even revised other people’s work quietly before and didn’t complain to avoid being seen as a know-it-all. But when they finally asked A to revise their part, they got labeled as bossy. How do you even deal with this kind of group dynamic?
623;1;If you feel like you’re a “victim” of being ganged up on, lemme ask you something. What’s the difference between you and the people you think “ganged up” on you—if you end up dragging the issue to a base post and basically cause the same thing? You’re just feeding the drama too, dude. Get some help. You're problematic as hell, man.
624;1;Ugh I’m so confused. I wanna watch some Netflix movies but it’s so hard to find someone selling access that’s reliable. Any recommendations where to look?
625;1;and now... i am worried about my future.
626;0;Just started dating someone from HI'22 hehehehe
627;1;I got called for an interview around the end of January and I think this is my last bullet. Can I ask for your prayers, guys? Hope everything goes well and I get accepted, lol.
628;0;Sometimes, the ones with innocent faces are scarier inside than those who look fierce on the outside, WKWK.
629;1;Weeeh, why are guys so hard to understand?
630;0;Btw, suddenly craving lobster after watching a K-drama wkwkwk
631;2;Guys I need your opinion… So I have this friend who’s kinda hurtful when they talk and super judgmental. I’ve been keeping it in because I don’t like confrontations, but honestly I’ve had enough. Should I just be straightforward or keep staying quiet? I’m not good at this stuff
632;1;Honestly, I feel like I chose the wrong major... but I’m not sure if I actually did or if I just haven’t adjusted yet?
633;0;"There are two types of people in this world:
1. People who believe life is out of their control, that external factors rule everything and they’re just unlucky.
2. People who say, “I can’t control the world, but I can control how I respond to it.”
Be the second kind, and success will follow you."
634;0;To the B22 IBM Alsut student with the purple hair—your hair looks amazing!
635;1;What does it mean when you have both an F2F and an online class (VC) scheduled at the same time and for the same course?
636;0;Tell me a local myth from where you’re from. I’ll go first: “Sundanese men are forbidden from marrying Javanese women.”
637;1;Why can’t our Speaker of the House speak English?
638;1;To one of the girls from SASJEP B24: “If I’m the worst person you’ve ever met, I’m really sorry.”
639;1;I swear I never enrolled in this course—ADVANCED IN BUSINESS APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT—but suddenly it’s on my schedule. Is this like a compulsory class for SI students?
640;2;"12 hours to deadline, no one in the group has done anything… Should’ve just done this individually. I’m so done.
How do I get permission to work solo?? Everyone’s just so passive."

642;1;Question for the girls—what do you do if your crush doesn’t text you for an entire day?
643;2;"Some of the campus security guys at Alsut give off weird, catcall-y vibes.
Just today, one of them said “Put on your mask, pretty girl” to my friend when we entered campus.
I told her, “That was creepy,” and she said it’s happened before when she’s alone.
Any other girls at Alsut experienced this too? It's super uncomfortable, seriously."
645;0;Are there any botis at Anggrek-Syahdan? I wanna make friends uwu
646;2;Midterms: Mentally Totally Fried.
647;1;Been trying to live a stable life, avoid negativity and drama. It’s been great! I’ve achieved a lot. But somehow... it all feels bland. I guess I’m just too used to chaos. Peace feels weird.
648;2;The course is already hard and tricky, the lecturer's super strict, and the Zoom audio sounds like it's underwater. My brain's officially mush, bro.
649;1;Guys, how do you apply for a Letter of Recommendation and SPTJM (Statement of Absolute Responsibility)? Please tutor me
650;1;For those who want to donate, I suggest adding paper, markers, or tape too. The team on the ground sometimes runs out of supplies to label donation boxes. It seems small, but it helps a lot. Thanks!

652;2;This one’s for the guy who ghosted and blamed the girl for “not making the first move.” I did start the convo, asked him out, we watched a movie... AND HE STILL GHOSTED ME. Literal demon from Pasir Kaliki
653;1;Don’t know why cyberbullies only got courage online—never face-to-face. Not that bullying is ever okay, but if it’s for somewhat reasonable things... maybe. But bullying someone over how they look or sound?? That’s just pathetic.
654;0;My extended family group chat be like: “OMG the police shot a civilian,” “We must protect the clerics,” “See? The police are Jokowi’s puppets.” Meanwhile, the cousins-only group: “LMAO that extremist got shot,” “Serves him right,” “Drink camel pee for heaven, bro.” Ah, the beauty of diversity
655;0;One, two, three and four, five, six, seven, eight, If you find a new circle, babe, don’t forget your old mates.

657;1;Oiii why is newbimay down
658;2;How do you stop feeling insecure about your own face?
659;2;"Every time I reread my chats with them... it hurts.
It’s always me starting the convo, showing care, asking questions.
Slowly I’m wondering... is this effort even worth it if they never respond the same way?"
660;2;So sad we don’t even get a graduation ceremony... thanks, Covid.
661;2;"I already signed up for enrichment, had the whole biz plan laid out, and boom—my partner just ditched. Said they weren’t “sure about the business” anymore.
You could’ve said something earlier so we could switch together, not stab me in the back like that. Now you’re all comfy with your new group and I’m left scrambling.
You really threw me away like I was nothing.
And when I said I felt discarded, you told me I was being dramatic? Nah, I’ve got every right to be pissed.
Don’t come to me when you need help again. Seriously."
662;0;Hey Binus girls~ let’s chat, maybe we’ll find our soulmate. I'm bored this holiday anyway hehe
663;1;Got a groupmate with zero ethics. Doesn’t contribute, just dead weight, and when I speak up, they call me too sensitive. Ugh.

Upperclassmen are already stressed over internships, don’t add outfit management to their list, please."
666;2;"I honestly don’t know what this feeling is. He came into my life so unexpectedly, right when I was a mess and totally unprepared to handle anything. We got introduced all of a sudden. I’ve tried meeting new people before, but it never felt like this.

He moved fast, and everything felt too real—so real that it actually scared me. I’ve never experienced something like this before. And then, out of nowhere, his mom started shipping us?! I almost had a heart attack.

I keep telling myself not to get too attached, ‘cause what if he’s just a player? But every time I start to doubt him, he somehow senses it—like he’s reading my mind—even though I never say anything out loud. And he always ends up shutting down all my doubts. That’s the part that gives me chills, like... how does he even do that?

But when I’m around him, I feel safe and comfortable. Even though we’re not that far apart in age, he feels so mature. Honestly, it’s like he gives off dad vibes sometimes 😭

I’ve never met a guy my age who could keep up with my way of thinking. Most of them are still into short-term fun, but he’s the first one who seems aligned with me.

I don’t think this is love, lol, because I don’t feel butterflies or my heart racing when we’re together—it’s just calm. Like pure comfort. But I’m still kinda frustrated trying to figure out what this feeling is… It’s just so mixed up and messy.
"
667;1;Feels like a private class. There are 40 students in the room, but less than 5 actually talk
668;1;Quick question—when doing the TFI assignment, does the group have to be from the same major or can we mix different majors?
669;1;Is it just me or is this assignment load actually insane??
670;2;I’m so over words like “babe,” “dear,” “boss,” and all that cringy fake-affection crap. LIKE PLEASE STOP ACTING SWEET IF YOU’RE NOT SERIOUS. Honestly, instead of calling me “babe” or whatever, just call me “Your Majesty” or “My Lord.” That’d actually be more fun.
671;2;AYYY I’M IN THE SAME CLASS AS MY CRUSHHHH AGAIN. GOD PLEASE, THIS SEMESTER, LET ME GET CLOSE TO HIM
672;2;Anime these days… ARRRRRRR
673;1;Who’s this 16 y/o girl being all attention-seeky? Like chill
674;1;So freaking tired of group assignments. Some people actually work, some pretend to help but only give orders—with that fake pitiful voice too, ugh. Refused to meet at a friend’s place for group work… honestly, you’re lucky I didn’t just cross your name off the list.
675;0;Some people out here just wanna date to hook up. That’s it
676;1;I’m only in semester 3 and I just got a notification for graduation briefing on Binusmaya Like huh???

682;1;At this age, where do you even go to find real friends?
683;2;When are the KMK final exam schedules coming out??!!
684;1;Studying Operating Systems right now... I wanna diiiiieeee
685;1;Girls, quick question—anyone know how to stop or delay your period?
686;1;When you're in the lab, do you guys prefer using your own laptop or the campus PC?
687;2;Let’s end the year crying alone in our room
689;2;Can we talk about those people who, during online class, are only asked to help with the presentation but always say they “can’t” ‘cause they’re outside?? Like, seriously—have some self-awareness. College is YOUR responsibility, bro. If you're already a burden to your family, at least don’t be one to your friends too
690;1;Guys quick question—is it mandatory to tip after going to a salon? I’m planning to get my grad photo taken and thinking of going to the salon next to my kost, but I’m broke as heck (hello fellow broke uni student). If tipping is a must, how much tho? I usually go with my mom so I have no clue.
691;1;Got that one friend who’s all about the looks and flexing, but broke AF and always asking to borrow money every single day
692;2;When you’re stuck in the middle of two people fighting, and both of them keep venting to you… PLUS you suck at saying no and lowkey turn into an opportunist. Like bro what am I supposed to do
693;1;Just wanna ask—do students who choose to attend online actually have equal rights as those onsite? Like, when it comes to attendance and joining class?
694;1;I’d LOVE to get a programming course that uses Python. Kinda tired of using C++ all the time.
695;1;So... there’s no “Welcome to Campus” briefing at Alsut?
696;2;"Starting college during the pandemic really showed who your real friends are—and who were just temporary guests in your life.
People’s true colors came out, especially the ugly ones
I learned a lot from that, and honestly? It’s kinda sad.
I had a bunch of friends, and they all slowly faded away one by one.
Now I wanna make new ones again, but I don’t even know how anymore.
Anyone else feel the same? Got tips on how to make friends these days?"
697;2;"Why is YouTube Premium trial only 1 month?

698;2;"Okay guys lemme spill some tea.
So earlier I was in a meeting with my assistant manager and senior, right?
I knew my asmen was currently out at a client’s place with this guy I’ve been crushing on (let’s call him X).
Suddenly, mid-meeting, the asmen just bursts out laughing and goes:
“OMG guess what, X keeps a bunch of pics of random girls! He’s such a creep!”
I just laughed awkwardly like “Haha omg X, you’re wild haha”
But like… HELLO?? Why would she bring that up OUT OF NOWHERE during a meeting… and to ME???
It felt so random and off.
Thoughts, y’all? I’m confused lmao help

707;1;Anyone else bored at their internship? Same here
709;1;Chill, I won’t leak any details or spread their private stuff. But if you check their Twitter... it's all nudes. Sunib’s gonna flip if they find out

716;1;Excuse me, quick question—if I’ve already secured an internship and the enrichment app asks for site supervisor mapping, do I fill it now or later once the internship starts?
717;2;Hiring millennials with a boomer mindset is just weird to me. Like, if the job can be done remotely, why force us to go to the office? Unless it's top-secret stuff or you need to operate something physical—come on, it's 2020s. Let people choose. If the work gets done, what's the issue?

737;1;Can DKV students join BNCC too? Also, if I just wanna focus on learning UI/UX, is it still worth it to join BNCC?
738;0;Only during President Megawati’s era did Indonesia not have a First Lady
739;1;Hmm… I changed my mind. Turns out full onsite isn’t as fun as I thought. It feels cramped and stuffy—maybe because I haven’t been in a full classroom in a long time.
740;2;There are many ears willing to listen, but only a few hearts that truly understand.
741;0;Cantwell just showed up in my notifications after hibernating for so long.

746;1;Happy Valentine’s to UMN DKV’19. From someone at Sunib who wanted to send you something like three years ago, but I was too shy to ask for your dorm address. Hopefully your Sunib friend visits Suncur soon.

749;0;Just a little reminder.
750;0;How’s the weather, folks? It’s still safe and just cloudy here in Alsut. Stay safe, y’all.
751;1;I seriously don’t get it. There’s a huge-ass banner and people still cheat?
752;1;Sunib's service keeps getting worse, smh. They mess up, but we students are the ones who get the hard time. No responsibility at all.
753;2;They really pushed the internship deadline earlier. I’m so pissed—I’ve been waiting for a response from a company outside of Enrichment.
754;0;HBD to everyone whose birthday is today!

757;0;Anyone here play Play Together?
758;1;Is the class still available online?
759;2;My boyfriend's really mature. Sometimes when he annoys me, I hesitate to act upset or tell him I’m bothered. I’m scared he’ll say something like “wow, you’re being childish over this?” What should I do?
760;1;Breaking up is way too easy these days—just say “I’m bored” and it’s over.

766;0;To the seniors out there, mind sharing some tips or advice for us B26 kids?
767;2;OMG, even opening Bimay to check my assignments is slower than my pet turtle at home. The workload’s insane, and my attendance status is still messed up. I’ve complained twice with proof but it still says I don’t exist. Makes me wanna become Iron Man and fly away...
768;0;"Guys, just a quick tip. After an interview, when HR asks if you have any questions—don’t forget to ask these two:
What benefits do interns get? Like, if you're supposed to get a laptop but don’t ask, that’s a waste. I forgot to ask this during my interview, rookie mistake lol.
How long till the results are announced, and through what channel? (especially if you applied outside of the internship app)"
769;1;If we join IISMA, do we still have to pay for the course credits (SKS)?
770;1;Spent 250k for a one-month gym membership but only went on weekends. Is it worth it? Haven’t worked out in ages 'cause of internship—always coming home late
771;0;Hey, anyone who joined the briefing earlier—can you please share a quick summary?
772;1;f we don’t pick a community development location ourselves, will the campus assign it for us? And usually, are the assigned places far or close to campus?
773;2;Weak, drained, zero motivation, and always feeling lonely.
774;0;To B24 initials JH and JJ, let’s get to know each other

778;1;Wanna learn coding, but I seriously have no idea where to start :(((
779;1;Has Libra come back yet or what I miss that chaotic-curhat-posting mess, they kinda need to slap me with reality again lol.
780;2;"Excuse me, I’d like to discuss something. I’ve been meaning to post this, but due to controversy about a lecturer’s response and other things, it got delayed. I want to ask—why do women often wear outfits that reveal cleavage or stomachs, like crop tops, super short shorts, or ripped jeans at the knees? Some even wear clothes that tightly outline their bodies, including their chest area—this goes for both Muslims and non-Muslims. It seems like many women want to look like they have bigger boobs. Why is that? I know this depends on a person’s mindset and even fully-covered women still face negative things, like what we see in the news. I’m not blaming either side—whether it’s the women for their clothes or the men who can’t control themselves. Sorry if this question offends anyone, I’m genuinely confused and just want to understand it better.
DISCLAIMER: I won’t accept answers like “It’s my body, I wear what I want,” or “It’s just fashion, you’re so backward”—those are template replies that don’t help clarify anything."
781;1;Real talk—if you’re in an organization group and someone invites people to hang out but not you, is it okay to casually join in and say you wanna come too? Like… would that be fine or nah?
782;0;I really wanna experience watching a football match live in the stadium

786;1;Believe me, my feelings are more real than the lines you’re reading. Your name’s always in my prayers—sincere and true. So just accept it—the more you disappear, the more I remember you. –rkmnbrdr–
787;0;Yo, your girl/boy’s birthday today bro
788;1;Why does Bimay take forever to load just because I haven’t filled out the lecturer questionnaire yet?? I’m just trying to submit my assignment
789;2;Who else waited forever for an internship only to not get accepted
790;1;lite circle, brutal midterms.
791;1;This is my chat history from Jan 23 to Jan 30. That’s it. Honestly feelin’ super lonely. My friends’ chats are flooding like crazy in one day while mine... yeah.
792;1;So tired, my friends... so so tired.
793;2;No matter how pretty, kind, caring, or fun you are to your crush—if they’re still stuck in their past, it hurts like hell. You’re just a rebound, bro. cries in heartbreak
794;1;Has the new semester schedule come out yet or what?
795;1;Guys, for thesis stuff—is it usually a group or individual thing?
796;1;What exactly makes a girl or guy get labeled as “sasimo”? Like… how does that happen?
797;0;Yay, got accepted for internship!
798;1;If you’re super lazy to do your assignments, what’s the move to get that motivation back?

801;2;Hey SUNIB fam, please send some prayers. I got COVID—was OTG, now ODP, and now PDP. Hope I recover fast… your prayers mean a lot to me

810;0;Thank God Sambo finally got the death sentence.
811;2;Just the second day of 2023 and it’s already crap. Still can’t get an internship, and then my mom hit me with, “Still haven’t found one? Damn, you’re so unlucky.” Soon it'll turn into “That’s why smart people get internships easily, your GPA’s probably trash that’s why no one wants to hire you,” or “If you don’t graduate, get out of this house. I don’t want a bum for a kid, funding your college was probably a curse.” Maybe I really should’ve ended it all a long time ago...
812;0;I’d love to make new friends from Binus
813;1;Is Binusmaya down again or what??
814;2;You all who refuse to go onsite be out here chillin, mall hopping, catching movies. You think getting COVID from work and ending up hospitalized is just a game? Y’all in denial fr, what the hell.
815;2;"Hey guys, I’ve been struggling with college. Like, I understand the material when I study, but when it comes to actually doing assignments or applying it, I just freeze. I get stuck forever even on small problems 😭. I’m thinking of seeing a psychologist or maybe trying out Binus’ student consulting services. So like, for problems like this, do I go to SASC or what? Last time I tried them it felt more academic-focused, not really psychological. Anyone ever tried? Would appreciate your advice!
edit: sorry if it’s messy, first time venting here and I’m kinda nervous lol"
816;2;Found out a few months ago that my dad’s cheating, but he doesn’t know I know. I wanna confront him with proof, but I feel bad for my mom. Been bottling this up and it’s really eating me alive. I honestly don’t know what to do...
817;2;Literally millions of single people out there and you still go for someone else’s partner?? USE YOUR BRAIN!!
818;1;Would you rather have no friends at all or only have toxic ones?
819;2;"Watch out around Kemanggisan campus area!
Just yesterday I think I got scammed by someone pretending to collect donations. This stylish girl who looked like a student stopped me near Alfamart, said she’s from Yayasan Sahabat Hebat, talked about kids with cancer, disabilities, needing wheelchairs, etc. Showed me their real IG and photos of donors. Then came the soft push to “donate” Rp150K, in exchange for some super sketchy restaurant/hotel/karaoke vouchers I’ve never even heard of. Felt weird but I gave in cause I’m too nice for my own good. Later found out only 10% goes to the “charity,” rest to some shady marketing company. Might even be fake vouchers. Please stay sharp y’all—this scam’s still going around campuses and malls.

820;1;So I used to have this friend who always asked me to hang out, but back then I often went back to Jakarta so I couldn’t. Now that I’m around, I’m the one asking to hang but she’s always dry, barely replies, doesn’t seem interested. Did I do something wrong? I mean, it wasn’t that I didn’t want to back then—I just couldn’t.

824;2;"Guys I’m soooo embarrassed. So I met this guy (B23), we’d been talking for a few weeks, met him at church. During a house fellowship, he asked me to go to the bathroom with him. Then he was like, “Can I pull down your pants? Please, this is super important. But if you don’t want to, that’s totally fine, I understand and I’ll respect your decision.”
And… I actually let him. God I feel so stupid. He looked at my (sorry) vagina, said “okay thanks,” and that was it. Nothing else happened—thankfully.
But I feel like the dumbest girl alive. Why did I even say yes?? I feel like blaming him but also blaming myself. I can’t take it… I feel like I wanna disappear.

831;1;"Any haircut recs? I want something short but not army short, and if it’s long, I want it just enough to look like a K-pop oppa. I'm so lost, all I ever tell the barber is ""just clean it up a bit."""
832;1;They said “group work,” but all they did was watch me share my screen while I code. I should’ve just done it myself—at least I could vibe to music or do my own thing. Kinda uncomfortable having my whole screen on display. But whatever, I don’t mind carrying the team if it means I get smarter in the process.
833;1;Anyone here have friends who still don’t have an internship by semester 6? How does that even go down?
834;1;So what’s the COVID level that triggers Binus to go full online class? Or is it based on some zone color system?
835;2;"When your Data Structures lecturer asks,
“Any questions about RBT, AVL, MST, etc?”

839;2;"Guys I gotta share something about my little sister. She’s still in high school. So she told me there’s this guy who keeps following her around. He’s super quiet and it creeps her out—like he shows up everywhere she goes. She legit thought he was a psycho 😭

I didn’t wanna jump to conclusions, so I told her to switch up her walking buddies at school to see if he’s really following her or just happens to be around. At first she was like, “No way, it’s me he’s following, not my friends! He keeps staring at me.”

So I told her to walk randomly around places I know are rarely visited (I used to go to the same school). And yup—dude was following her.

I started freaking out too and told her to report it to a teacher I know actually cares. We also told our parents and they freaked out, thinking this guy’s a psycho and wanted him punished or even expelled.

Long story short, the school had him see a psychiatrist… and turns out, nope, not a psycho—just super shy. He wasn’t trying to hurt anyone, he just… liked my sister.

I was so shocked. And he’s not even from a rich family, so like, there’s no way the psych got bribed or anything.

Moral of the story, guys—don’t just go around labeling someone a psycho. It messed up everyone’s head and I feel so bad for judging the dude without knowing the full story.

Good news is, he opened up a bit, apologized for creeping her out… and now??

THEY’RE DATING. I’m shook

841;1;My crush asked me to hang out tomorrow and told me to let them know if I’m down. So I said yes... and they just replied “ok.” No follow-up, no “what time,” no “where are we going”—NOTHING. Am I overreacting for being mad and annoyed right now??

845;1;Serious question—if I got a big fat zero on my midterms, is there any hope of passing this semester?

856;2;"“Wow your internship’s easy, driven around in official cars?”
“Tired? But your work’s like... nothing.”
“Your office feels like your house, everyone’s scared of you.”

These came from three different friends and I’m so done. Especially the “that’s all?” part—ugh. I wanna explain but I know they’ll just come back with more nonsense. So I just let it slide... but it still stings."

986;2;Guys I need advice. I actually understand the course material, but every time I try to do assignments or study, I freeze. Like, really freeze. I hit a small bump, and boom — stuck for hours. It’s killing my flow. Thinking of seeing a psychologist or maybe just consulting Binus student services first. Anyone ever gone to SASC for stuff like this? Or got experience with it? Advice very much appreciated! (edit: sorry if it's hard to read — my first time posting here, kinda nervous )
987;2;"You jerk. This is our final project and you're just out there having fun while I do all the work?? You didn’t help at all. Just 'cause we’re in the same friend group doesn’t mean you can freeload. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly get a big fat zero for your UAS. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
"
988;2;"Can’t believe there are parents out there this toxic.
My best friend from high school (a girl, btw) had her tuition paid by my family ‘cause her own parents bailed.
And guess what her mom did?
She told everyone I was a homewrecker trying to steal her daughter’s boyfriend.
Like... ma’am. What?!
I’m literally not even into her like that. I just care about her as a friend.
And the real kicker? Her mom's mad because of my religion — I’m Hindu.
Now she’s telling people to kick me out of her daughter’s life.
My friend’s embarrassed and wants to run away from home.
I’m torn. I love her like a sister, but I might have to walk away for my own sanity.
This whole thing is messed up, man "

994;1;Not gonna lie, I’ve never joined any orgs since high school. Then suddenly this class forced me into an event committee. Now I’m overwhelmed and overthinking like crazy. Is it normal to feel this shocked?? I never knew org life was this chaotic
995;2;AAAAAAA THE TEASER PHOTOS OF IRENE AND YERI ARE OUTTTT!!! OMGGG THEY LOOK STUNNINGGG. I’M LOSING IT!!! FEEL MY RHYTHM ERA IS HITTING AGAINNNN IRENE, JOY, SEULGI, AND YERI ARE JUST UNREAL

999;1;Anyone got a survival guide for dealing with that one lecturer who’s overly extra and picky? I need help fr

1001;2;I really do wanna find someone serious… But it’s been ages since I felt that spark. Nowadays it’s just lust, and honestly? I hate it. I hate me for it. I miss the real feelings.
1002;1;Guys guys, the 9 million equipment fee back then gave my brother a laptop — How come we don’t get one now, huh??? Where did the money go
1003;1;Been on a diet for 3 weeks—zero workouts—and I’ve dropped 8 to 9 kg. Is that normal? Or am I not doing enough?
1004;1;Hey, anyone here Catholic and living around The Nest apartment? I’m signing up for catechumen classes, but apparently that church isn’t in my parish zone. So I need a letter from the parish where I actually live. Anyone know which parish The Nest falls under?
1005;1;Just realized my first crush was in 8th grade, turns out that’s considered late. Some of my friends had crushes since 2nd grade!! They even had this one super pretty girl everyone crushed on back in elementary lol. Even my lil sibling who’s still in grade school talks about their “crush” now. Am I the only one who was that slow?
1006;1;What does “package rejected” even mean? Like... did they just say “nah” to my delivery?
1007;2;MEYDEN: pretty and toxic while selling stuff and people still respect her. But when Deddy Corbuzier calls it out, he’s the one getting hate. Same with Ade Londok—double standards everywhere
1008;2;Being an overthinker is so freaking exhausting. One slight change in someone’s tone or chat style and I’m spiraling like: “Did I say something wrong? Are they mad at me??” Ever since I started uni, I feel stuck with people I don’t even vibe with. Sure, we look like a fun friend group on the outside, but I’ve been faking it the whole time. Constantly adjusting myself to fit in. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even know who I really am anymore. But if I stop doing that… I’d probably have no one.

1017;2;Fyuuhhh I’M. SO. DONE. Completely drained
1018;2;"So my friend’s dad called him yesterday like:
“You’re still in college and already chasing girls? Stop embarrassing me.
Focus on studying, join orgs if you want, part-time jobs are fine.
But girls? Forget it. You’re still a kid.”
Meanwhile, my dad goes:
“If you see a girl in class, canteen, library—even in front of the bathroom—go talk to her!
You’re in IT, barely any girls in your major.
Back when I was in electrical engineering, same story.
If you don’t make a move, you’ll end up like me—still single and struggling.”
So yeah… my dad literally encourages me to find girls.
And honestly? I’ve been crushing on someone and I think I’m finally gonna try making a move..."
1019;0;I just wanna be hugged by Eimi
1020;1;"At this point…

I’ve read that you should sleep well and avoid stress or depression. But seriously, I feel like crying. Studying at Binus is overwhelming—I can’t take it anymore...
1028;1;I'm halfway through midterms—please wish me luck to finish it all, guys.
1029;1;Are Spanish and Portuguese really different? They look quite similar to me.
1030;2;"""I can't do this or that because I'm an introvert""... ""I have trouble socializing because I'm an introvert""—come on, enough! Can we stop with the self-diagnosing? If you really feel something is off, go see a psychiatrist. Don’t hide behind the word ""introvert"" just because you’re afraid to face real life. Sorry for the harsh words, but people like this really frustrate me. I genuinely hope those people find peace within themselves and stop expecting everyone around them to understand. Thank you"

1043;2;I’m in a phase where I can’t stand being left alone without my boyfriend. I feel so empty when he’s not around. I know it’s toxic, but it’s so hard to change
1044;2;Yesterday’s Chinese New Year “grinding” result: zero (not including gifts from parents), pfft... I honestly don’t understand how people my age can get millions during CNY, with their earnings increasing every year. Me? I always obey, but year after year I get nothing. “Maybe because you’re already working?” — Nope, I’m still financially dependent on my parents. “Maybe they think you’re old enough and don’t need it anymore?” — Possibly. Or maybe because we’re the outcasts of the extended family. The truth is, our family has been excluded from the larger family because we’re seen as poor (based on my mom’s experiences and observations). Most of our extended family lives in a true “Chinatown” kind of environment—where material wealth is highly, extremely valued. Even though my parents and I still have good relations with some relatives, that doesn’t mean they’re generous. It still feels... distant.
1045;2;I was about to move on, but then we met at Binus today and hung out until late... how could I not catch feelings again?
1046;1;I think I’ve been affected by toxic positivity all this time.

1048;1;Seeing my juniors in high school now makes me think—why was I born so early? But it’s okay, I’m grateful because my seniors back in high school were also really cool.

1054;2;I’m exhausted and I don’t know why. Even after sleeping all day, I still feel tired and drained.
1055;2;I wanted to summarize the material, but watching the Zoom recording just made things more confusing. The lecturer’s explanation didn’t help at all—I just ended up mentally drained.
1056;1;I guess some girls really just aren’t into guys, huh?
1057;2;Starting a love story at this age... it’s kind of difficult. I don’t even know where to begin.
1058;2;Seriously, who came up with the rule to wear traditional attire for every Citizenship class? It’s such a hassle! Do they think renting traditional outfits is cheap?
1060;1;Is it actually a sin to convert from Christianity to Catholicism and vice versa?
1061;2;For first-semester Computer Science students, if you fail the midterm and final for Algoprog, does that mean you definitely have to repeat the course? Because in the second semester, we no longer learn C. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
1062;1;Any tips so I don’t get bored easily while doing online finals? Thanks in advance.
1063;0;Any tips on how to approach a shy guy who’s never dated or had a crush his entire life?
1064;2;What do you usually give yourself as a self-reward? Please answer.
1065;1;Has anyone heard of Sneakers Dept? Are their products original?
1066;1;Only three days off? Even kindergarten kids would laugh at that.
1067;1;An expensive campus but poor in ethics. Maybe Binus is just not your level of campus?
1068;2;This lecturer really loves diagrams, huh? Even questions in the midterm that have nothing to do with diagrams still require them. What kind of diagram are we supposed to include? An economics diagram, sir?
1069;0;Hahahahahahahaha

1074;0;Hello everyone! For those of you from the mobility program in Malang, could you please help fill out this questionnaire for our research course https://forms.gle/4ffQ7MHigkz9otRu5 Thank you so much! Wishing that whoever fills it out gets transported to another world (isekai).
1075;0;Just want to say, when a girl looks away while talking to a guy, it could mean she is shy, not that she hates him. So do not jump to negative conclusions — from me, a shy girl who cannot hold eye contact for too long.
1077;2;Guys, for the OJ SOCS, if we are unsure about our answers, should we still submit them? Because before the final exam, if there are problems we have not tried, they said we can send them to the lecturer but the score will only be 50%. If we send it to the lecturer, does that mean only the output is checked, not through OJ?
1078;1;Does the report feature here actually work?
1079;2;Arrrrrghhhhhh
1080;1;I want to ask for opinions—do students who choose online classes actually have the same rights as those attending onsite? In terms of class participation and attendance?
1081;0;In your campus, do students sit separately during creative class?
1082;2;How do I cheer up my little sister who just broke up less than a month ago? I feel sad too because during their almost two-year relationship, they spent so much time together.
1083;2;Are the Algoprog final exam questions similar or relevant from year to year? I got last year’s exam guide—do you think it can be used as a reference?
1084;1;Male 22 is spamming like crazy. I will expose him—he is gay. His X (Twitter) account has a lot of nude photos.
1085;1;It is hard to find a compatible partner, so please, if you find one, fight for it.
1086;2;Accusing someone of getting someone pregnant, ruining their reputation, and claiming to be their partner— that is really messed up. That could actually be charged as defamation.
1087;2;What is the point of having community service and SAT? That is really unnecessary.
1088;2;Please let me share something—I am very confused about what to do for Valentine’s Day. I plan to bake a cake for my crush, but I am really scared it will make him uncomfortable (we are already friends). But at the same time, I feel like I should not give him nothing on Valentine’s Day. I really need your opinions, especially from the guys. I keep going back and forth on this... I need some encouragement too.
1089;2;Hi, is there any Computer Science student who is being placed into embedded systems next semester because they forgot to fill out the specialization form, like me?
1090;1;Just laughing and joking around and suddenly it is internship time.
1091;1;Sex education in Indonesia is extremely rigid. In textbooks, it only talks about sexual organs, sexually transmitted diseases, and morality. We are never taught what to do if something happens to our private parts or about the concept of consent. In Indonesia, we are taught morality, but only in theory. Discrimination still happens everywhere. For example, victims of sexual violence still do not feel safe reporting what they have experienced.
1092;2;I am really sad that my friend has changed since getting into a relationship. We used to be open with each other and laugh a lot, but now they never have time for me. It feels like I only exist when they need me, but when I need them, they are nowhere to be found.
1093;0;Can anyone recommend a place to buy a secondhand iPhone?
1094;1;Is the Operating Systems course seriously only 100 minutes long?
1095;2;Seriously, coding on paper during midterms? Why not just do it on stone while we are at it?
1096;1;The first day of onsite class starts with an internship.
1097;2;I think I need another form of madness to overcome this madness.
1098;1;What is this uneasy feeling? After hanging out with my friends, my partner felt a bit off when I got home.

1100;0;"Nonsense can turn into ""Mixue talk"""
1101;1;Is there anyone who regrets coming here?
1102;2;What is up with this SunibGaming who keeps disliking people's comments? If you have ever criticized SunibGaming, they will hold a grudge forever. I noticed that every time he replies to my comment, there is always one dislike. Get a life, man.
1103;1;Are there any Sunib students going to Jeff Satur’s concert in February?
1104;2;Please, just make one GSLC assignment enough. I know it is only once a week, but the tasks are non-stop.
1105;1;Wish me luck, guys. I have an interview coming up.
1106;0;Has anyone ever bought a mystery box from the vending machine at Binus Anggrek? How much does it cost?
1107;1;Someone already finished their final exams, huh?
1108;1;Can you please share some tips on how not to get bored quickly with what we are doing?
1109;0;Does anyone know the Saturday operating hours for SSC? From what time to what time?
1110;0;I look good today, so I feel happy whenever I look in the mirror.
1111;0;Will tomorrow’s Indonesian class allow open book?
1112;2;I really want to gain some muscle soon. Please share some workout tips, especially those who go to the gym.
1113;2;"We have already ""made up"", but why does it still feel like this? You ask me to make more effort, but you are not putting in any effort yourself. Please try to see things from more than just your own point of view."
1114;2;Has anyone ever gone for a consultation with SASC? How was it? I think I might need some professional help.
1115;2;Can anybody please help me get out of here? I can no longer handle this, and SLSC is not helping at all.
1116;1;How far is your round trip to campus? Mine is around 30 kilometers.
1117;2;Here is a bit of a conspiracy. From PCR tests, antigen tests, and so on, there are certain parties (I will not name them) who are profiting. When the number of cases goes down, people are no longer scared and do not test when they get mild symptoms. But then, if fewer people test, how do they make money? So, they raise the number of reported cases. This has also happened in other countries, by the way. Logically, in a season like this, flu has always been common. And do not be surprised—the flu spreads very quickly. Look at how the symptoms of COVID and the flu are always described as similar, the rising case numbers, and the current situation—it makes people scared and leads them to test again. More profit. The same goes for vaccine companies, which often add new required doses. Some even work with their competitors just to increase vaccine consumption. That is all from our group. Thank you.
1118;1;For those who applied for the Merdeka Internship, is today the simulation for the diversity test?
1119;2;There is no break at all after midterms? I am exhausted—I just want a proper rest, seriously.
1120;1;He might be a 10, but if he eats Padang rice for breakfast and dinner, I would immediately back off.
1121;0;Is there anyone here who plays Clash Royale?
1122;0;If anyone has any group chat for batch B25, please share it. Thank you.
1123;1;Is it still possible to attend classes online this semester? If so, how? I already changed the option but the Zoom link is not showing.
1124;2;I am only in my first semester, and honestly, I feel kind of lonely. I really want to build a relationship, whether it is romantic or just friendship.
1125;2;Excuse me, my tutor invited my crush to do a Spotify Blend. What should I do?
1126;1;I do not like showing my face, because my appearance does not meet the typical Indonesian beauty standards. Even having grades below standard is already bad enough—let alone my face.
1127;0;What year is Antoni Wijaya from Binus?
1128;1;I am currently confused whether I should continue college or switch to a bootcamp. After one semester, I feel that college is too general. I want to focus directly on preparing for work. But it feels like a waste of the money I have already paid.
1129;1;For now it is still increasing. I am waiting for Tuesday, hoping there will be no changes.
1130;2;A 100-minute session is fine, as long as they provide at least one king-sized bed at the back of the class. Sitting for over 3 hours is exhausting.
1131;1;How are you all feeling right now?
1132;0;Please share snack or food recommendations near Binus Kemanggisan for when classes start again. So that this feed is not always filled with arguments.
1133;2;My brain is exhausted after cramming for the midterms, and now that it is over, I end up overthinking.
1134;2;Daniel, are you not done disliking all of my comments? I ignored you and now you are getting bolder.
1135;0;I tried mentai for the first time, and it was incredibly delicious.
1136;1;I was invited to go to Nako, but my house is too far.

1139;2;I am so annoyed with someone who has a circle group that includes me and their other friends, but they do not use it to ask questions. Instead, they message me privately and do not even say “thank you.”
1140;1;Is Sunib (BINUS University in Bekasi) a good university?
1141;1;In your opinion, when getting closer to someone, should you feel comfortable first or catch feelings first? Please include your reasons.
1142;0;Can you suggest a major that has a lot of individual work?
1143;2;Is this even reasonable? GSLC 1 assignment, class presentation after midterms (before Christmas), project presentation to an organization (before Christmas), report revisions, more reports, report defense, entrepreneur course with VPC and storytelling, and still have to think about midterms? Am I the only one who cannot handle this?
1144;2;I just finished midterms today, and tomorrow I already have two classes. Why could they not just start on Monday so we could have a little break after the exams?
1145;0;For the final exam in Entrepreneurship: Market Validation, what do we usually have to do?
1146;0;In your opinion, what is the definition of a friend? What is the difference between an acquaintance and a friend?
1147;1;How do you tell the difference between liking someone and just feeling comfortable with them?
1148;2;I feel like crying, I could not answer any of the questions at all.
1149;1;Has anyone ever asked a lecturer to do a group assignment individually? Do you think they would allow it? For example, a final project.
1150;2;Why was the class moved earlier to the 13th? The answer from LSC was because it follows the academic calendar provided by the government. Is that really true? It seems suspicious.
1151;1;Has anyone ever requested a letter from Binus regarding a paid application? How do you go about it?
1152;2;The person who keeps making posts defending that side seems to always be from M18, and the vocabulary used is not very different each time.
1153;2;One thing about SLSC is that when I file a complaint, it feels like they do not care at all. They only forward it to their superiors, but nothing actually gets done. Please just do your job properly.
1154;1;I really miss the Lawson store at Anggrek campus.
1155;2;Who else here is annoyed by the new Binusmaya platform? I want to make a petition to bring back the old version.
1156;1;“When are you going to start working on your final exam?” Me: maybe today, maybe tomorrow, or maybe later.
1157;0;I was in the toilet and saw a lizard jump from one wall to another. Instead of being scared, I was amazed. It looked like something out of Spiderman.
1158;0;For CB references, should they be placed after each answer or all compiled in the bibliography section?
1159;0;Just sitting and listening to her excitedly tell stories after her first day of internship was just... perfect.
1160;1;I am from B23, semester 7, attending onsite classes to retake a failed course. I wonder if anyone wants to join me.
1161;1;For those of you worried about your GPA dropping, do not be discouraged. In my first and second semesters, my GPA was below 3.0, but in the third and fourth it went above 3.4. The key is not to assume that your lecturers are bad or think the subject is too difficult. Stay positive and respect your lecturers.
1162;2;Honestly, I am very confused about what career path to take after finishing my bachelor’s degree. I am considering working in the private sector, maybe in the insurance field since I know quite a bit about it. But on the other hand, I also want to become a police officer or join the military.
1163;0;I want to have a Christmas dinner with my friends. Do you have any place recommendations?
1164;1;"Final exams start tomorrow. I would like to ask the seniors from B25, B24, B23, and also alumni in Suncur: what are your honest opinions about the B26 batch? It is okay to express anything; we B26 will accept whatever you say."
1165;2;I want to get a job through internal connections—not because I am lazy to apply, but because I am tired of hearing about fake job postings. Lately, I have been searching for internships and suddenly my number gets spammed by scammers.
1166;2;Sorry, SunibGaming, but I cannot stop laughing whenever I see your replies on people’s posts. They get so many dislikes even though your replies are totally fine.
1167;1;The student organization leader talks too much and acts like they are more important than they really are.
1168;1;Why is it that in every student event, committee members are always required to buy shirts?
1169;1;Do you think it is wrong if I often go out alone?
1170;0;Eating meatballs sounds good this afternoon.
1171;1;I am already tired and the final exams have not even started yet. What should I do?
1172;2;You chat with me, share your stories with me, even study with me, but you inform someone else. I guess it is just a different level of priority.
1173;0;It is noisy again next door.
1174;2;Sometimes I feel extremely exhausted because my mom is the person I love the most, but also the one who hurts me the most. I sometimes feel like ending everything because of this. I want to cut off all attachment, but I never can. I am tired of the verbal abuse, followed by acts of affection as if nothing happened. Sorry for dumping my trauma, I just needed to let this out.
1175;0;If you meet me like this, Covered in mud, with sweat soaking the earth, Imprisoned, Confined, punished, With only loneliness as my companion, Could you still appreciate This pure love of mine?
1176;1;How do I tell my parents that I am not just sleeping during the day? I am genuinely resting because I was working hard on exam preparations all night. I really cannot do any thinking during the day. My brain simply refuses to work then.
1177;0;Does anyone know who lives in Silkwood Oak 1402? I want to ask them to watch Netflix together.
1178;1;Is a score in the 70s considered safe?
1179;1;What time does BeeHub at Binus open?
1180;2;The lecturer who made the midterm exam questions for managerial accounting clearly has never worked as an accountant. The questions were totally messed up.
1181;1;"My mom just now said this about my significant other: ""… unfortunately, they are of a different religion..."""
1182;2;Is it possible for us to apply for internships through both the Bimay enrichment apps and Magang Merdeka at the same time?
1183;1;I am extremely nervous about going back to my original campus.
1184;0;I want to become a first leader just so I can get closer to a girl from B27.
1185;1;If I have only made one payment for fixed tuition, will I still receive my class schedule?
1186;2;Sometimes I really feel like dying. If you do not like it, feel free to dislike. I often feel exhausted, but I force myself to appear strong. Some people even say they want to be like me, but they only see the positive side. They do not see the dark side of me that I have never shared with anyone.
1187;1;Is it wrong to have a crush on someone from class of 2023? I am from class of 2022 and I like an IT student from class of 2023. I want to tell them, but I am afraid of being rejected. They probably would not want someone from an older class.
1188;1;Look at you, missing someone but too proud to admit it, secretly trying to find out how they are and checking on them.
1189;0;For those of you with two block, comma, curtain hairstyles, how often do you trim the sides?
1190;2;To all the boys who hurt me during middle school, screw you. S.C.R.E.W Y.O.U. Especially to Rizky, that guy from the next alley. Screw you, Rizky.
1191;2;Do not easily believe the thread posted about (R), that person did not even provide any proof and is just randomly framing (R)? I know who you are, and it turns out SASC has not taken any action yet. I hope you enjoy your holiday before you get summoned and face consequences.

1193;1;I just had an exam in Algorithm and Data Analysis, but I think I might have ADHD now—seriously, I had to redo the Huffman and Kruskal MST questions three times because I kept making careless mistakes.
1194;1;There are so many Sunib students going to the gym lately, but strangely, it does not look like they work out at all. Maybe it is just bad genetics. Just go be a corporate slave, kid.
1195;1;Can I get some advice on how to approach a girl from another campus? I have had a crush on her since high school but I never had the courage.
1196;2;How do you get a partner as an introvert during this pandemic? I was already introverted before, and now the pandemic has completely ruined my social skills.
1197;0;Getting an internship through an interview? No. Getting an internship through gossip? Yes. (Don’t worry, I am also confused.)
1199;1;We never talked. Happy birthday to you.
1200;2;Damn, I enrolled in IT but ended up studying biology.
1201;0;Hey guys, uncles and aunties, does anyone know where I can buy a used automatic motorcycle?
1202;2;"My friend (a girl) told me she used to date a guy who believed in ""gender equality means splitting the bill."" After the first date, she agreed to always split bills. Even when he drove her somewhere, she would ask, ""Do I need to cover the gas?"" She was totally fine with having a 50/50 relationship. After about three months, the guy might have realized, ""Why is she never bothered by paying for her own food, movie tickets, etc.?"" One day, he asked her, ""Do you have a job outside of college? Where does your income come from?"" After she explained, they had a long talk, and based on his expression, he seemed uncomfortable. A few weeks later, they broke up. She said he got insecure when he found out she works, freelances, owns a small business, and—thank God—does not ask her parents for money anymore, unlike him. For guys, it is fine to believe in splitting bills, but if the girl is independent, earns her own money, and does not need a single penny from you, do not become a coward and insecure about her success."
1203;1;At least I have friends.
1204;1;My CB lecturer is so unclear, constantly spamming the forum.
1205;2;Oh my God, why does the online interview keep freezing? I am so pessimistic now. I am probably going to get rejected. Goodbye.
1206;1;Are Geminis really that bad? Honestly, I am a Gemini and I do admit I have some of those traits, but I do not think I am that evil.
1207;0;"My notifications are full of ""pudingcokelat""."
1208;1;Suggestions for jobs for someone who can speak English but is not good at socializing, please. I want to be a task proxy but I am afraid of committing sins.
1209;1;Does anyone know which parts to study for the OS essay? There is too much material, it is confusing.
1210;1;I really want to do the midterm at the boarding house alone, I feel too lazy at home and it is not peaceful for working on it.
1211;2;How do you use IBM SPSS 25? I am confused.
1212;0;POKKKPOKKKKCHOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
1213;1;Does size matter? Mine is only four inches or ten centimeters.
1214;1;I just finished class and went to check the rain, but then I saw a girl dressed like in anime school uniforms. She was also using an umbrella because of the drizzle. She was very eye-catching... but definitely someone from a rich family.
1215;2;Has the computer science batch already taken the discrete math midterm? Is the multiple choice link on socs1/tcexam working for everyone? I tried logging in but it kept saying the email and password were incorrect.
1216;2;Guys, if there is a course that requires the lecturer to speak English, but the lecturer is not very fluent and it makes the material hard to understand, is it okay to complain? Or at least give some criticism?
1217;0;To Chinese-Indonesian girls at Sunib, would you be interested if an ordinary guy tried to get close to you?
1218;2;I deserve no one.
1219;1;I am going away... maybe I need to act indifferent for a while so you will notice.

1222;1;I want to live in a boarding house again. I really miss the lively environment around my boarding house. I never felt lonely even though I slept alone and did not have any roommates. I just do not miss the struggles of paying for the electricity token and figuring out how to save money to have enough to eat.
1223;2;"To anyone who responds with ""ARE YOU SERIOUS??"" whenever I ask a question, I will pinch your kidney, you local monkey!!! I am so tired of getting that response these past few weeks."
1224;1;For those who switched tracks to SSI after filling out the form, is there any update?
1225;2;I hate my parents. I despise you, mother and father.
1226;0;Is there any girl here who can use Photoshop? Let us get to know each other, I would like to have a female friend who is an editor.
1227;1;The final exams are done. I hope my lecturers will be merciful with the grades, I am really hoping for it.
1228;2;Lecturer is right + student is wrong = UNDERSTANDABLE. Student is right + lecturer is wrong = DISRESPECTFUL.
1229;1;What in the world. A management student from Alsut (Shayn*)—I first saw her during orientation, she was incredibly beautiful. But when I found out more about her, it turned out she is a nightlife person who likes to go clubbing, always hanging out with guys. There were also a lot of guys saying she often seeks attention from men just because she is pretty. That is a complete turn-off. Nowadays, it is really hard to find a pretty girl who is not strange—too often they turn out to be nightlife people or clubgoers.
1230;0;Is there any news about the midterm grades, friends?
1231;1;You and I, what are we if we are not together?
1232;1;I often forget that I need a support system from other human beings. ~lcu
1233;1;To the female student who was making TikTok videos during yesterday’s online class, I just want to say—if you are going to act foolish, at least do not make it obvious.
1234;1;Guys, I want to ask. In the enrichment program, there is something called independent study—what does that actually mean? Does it just mean studying at home?
1235;1;To everyone out there, please use your money wisely. Do not spend it on buying fake license plates or installing strobe lights. Do you think that is cool? You do not have the capacity to use such things, bro.
1236;2;This is the first time I received an answer like this from a guy when I asked, “Are you brave enough to face my parents?” He replied, “Not to face them, but to embrace them.”
1237;1;To be honest, I do not like being compared in any aspect. But if you are comparing my wealth to theirs, in this case, I cannot deny it.
1238;1;Even though I have only been staying at home, my body feels sore all over
1239;2;These days, if you want to work but do not have a laptop, it must be really difficult, right?
1240;1;Guys, suppose you have a friend who you are no longer close to, someone who rarely talks to you or chats anymore, and suddenly that friend messages you just to ask for assignment answers—how would you respond?
1241;1;I wonder what it feels like to be pursued by a girl. Why has it never happened to me?
1242;1;First day of internship, I am not ready to meet new people yet.
1243;1;When do grade point averages usually come out?
1244;1;I had a morning class today, but my dream was too beautiful. Fortunately, I was not late.
1245;0;I do not need astrology. I take full responsibility for my own behavior.
1246;2;Has anyone done Beelingua A1.2 unit 1 on WH-questions? I really need help with this.
1247;1;In your opinion, is it appropriate for a girl to ask a lot of personal questions to her male best friend?
1248;1;I want a boyfriend from the same campus, please. So after class, when I am tired, there is someone to accompany me—maybe have lunch at the cafeteria, skip class and go to the mall, or just hang out. Whatever it is.
1249;2;I got close to a senior male student and we had been chatting for almost a month, but then he suddenly disappeared. He has not replied to or even read my messages. What should I do? I feel sad.
1250;2;Instead of feeling motivated when I woke up this morning, I felt drained the moment I saw the midterm questions.
1251;2;“Just search for it online, it is easy.” Easy? It took me two hours to find the answer for one case, and there were nine children in that one question—and there are four questions. Dear lecturers who verify the questions, please review them again. Do not just take questions from Chegg blindly.
1252;1;Help, my mother smells. Please give me a tutorial on how to wash a mother.
1253;2;Organizing an event but cannot pay? That is really idiotic. The volunteers were even asked to pay. The committee, student council, and the event chair disappeared without a trace. I feel really bad for the volunteers. Just attend class and go home—that is the best way to avoid toxic organizations.
1254;1;Dear girls, do you usually prefer guys who drive two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicles?
1255;0;Are the teaching assistants also teaching in the second semester?
1256;2;I am literally very anxious right now.
1257;2;My mind was completely blank while doing the Religion CB assignment.
1258;0;It is not that I am procrastinating, it just feels more exciting when the deadline is near.
1259;0;For your information, for new students or other Binusians who may not know yet, you can see what you will study in the next semester and the overview of the subjects from the following website: https://curriculum.binus.ac.id/program/. Just search for your major, and usually the course structure can be found on page 6 or 7.
1260;2;I have never watched football my entire life, but last night I really could not take my eyes off the screen!
1261;1;What do you all think about the lecturer reviews on Twitter Binusfess? There is another commotion about it on Twitter right now.
1262;2;Do I have to commit suicide first before everyone regrets not coming to see me, greet me, or interact with me? Then they will say things like “Why did you go that far?”, “Are you okay?”, “Forgive us for not noticing your presence,” “Sorry we ignored you,” “Sorry we did not know you felt excluded.” Do I really have to sit or stand at the edge of a balcony before people realize that someone has been feeling left out?
1263;1;Bimay is slow. The solution is to use Microsoft Teams. The lecturer already created a group on Teams. But still teaches and assigns tasks via the WhatsApp group. Lack of technological skills.
1264;1;The fifth semester is really tough. I am exhausted.
1265;0;For those who know sunibgaming in real life, what is that person like? Are they just as weird as they are on suncur?
1266;2;Sometimes, attention to detail is really important. I uploaded the first version of my exam correctly, but when uploading the second version, I accidentally uploaded the question file instead. And the stupid part is I did not get the chance to check because I was rushing to add the answers (it was a timed exam). For the first time in my life, I might get no score just because of carelessness.
1267;1;Being fought for but not understanding that you are being fought for.
1268;1;I want to ask the girls, how do you regulate your period? Because I have not gotten my period for more than six months.
1269;0;Do men prefer independent women or clingy ones?
1270;0;https://youtu.be/eMY-qbs75ug Play it on minute 1:45 - 2:17 quick reminder to us all
1271;1;For those who applied to CTI yesterday, has there been any update after the psychological test?
1272;2;Everyone, please do not bully Sunibgaming. He might create another new account again.
1273;2;Life is quite funny, is it not? Unbelievable.
1274;2;Oh my goodness, the algorithm midterm test included a case that was never taught in class.
1275;2;I was the one who wanted to experience what sexual intimacy feels like, but instead, someone else gets to have it...
1276;2;The exam score did not meet my expectations.
1277;2;The exam schedule on Bimob has been released. No!
1278;0;Hey, I want to ask, can the Sunib Flazz card be used for MRT?
1279;1;After about two weeks of my air conditioner being broken, I have been sleeping using only a fan, forced to shower every morning due to sweating, and no longer love my favorite blanket. But strangely, I feel healthier and more energized.
1280;1;Hi, does anyone know where to access Binus Ebooks now?
1281;2;No one in my class has actually completed the Mobile Multimedia Solution project. It is extremely difficult, and no one in my group owns a Mac. Even when we borrow one, the time is very limited.
1282;1;Is the passing grade for a course determined by just the midterm score, the final exam score, or a combination of assignments, midterms, and finals?
1283;1;To those who are working on their thesis, stay strong. Do not leave your thesis blank, or it might turn into an ice cream shop.
1284;1;I posted an NGL before 2022 ended, but no one responded... it feels so disappointing.
1285;1;Goodbye, everyone. I am leaving Suncur. It is no longer fun. Thank you for the past two years.
1286;1;I think the Citizenship exam is more difficult than Pancasila or Religion.
1287;1;I like the darkness. There's something to the feeling of not knowing your surroundings, not seeing the color of things as they appear, but as they truly are. There's something about the unknown, the quiet, the cold. There's something unspoken about the dark, something I can never quite put words to. Something terrifying yet beautiful.
1288;0;What will you all be doing today? (Considering this is the last day of 2022.)
1289;1;If the car parking at Binus Alam Sutera is full, where else can I park with a cheap parking rate?
1290;2;L'ik'ik Talokan, you idiot.
1291;1;Please be patient... it is just accepting a friend request in a game. I have been busy since yesterday. It is really annoying, especially since I am not even close with the person.
1292;1;When will the PAPB results be announced? I forgot the date.
1293;1;Until we bloom again, my dandelions. I know I made you happy, but I suppose you are happier without me.
1294;0;Do you all have an assignment from BIFEST that requires submitting the community service?
1296;1;I felt completely blank when I saw the Object-Oriented Programming questions.
1298;0;What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of onsite and online exams?
1299;1;Why does it feel different when buying an item for 60 thousand with free shipping compared to buying something for 46 thousand plus 14 thousand for shipping?
1300;0;Is there any senior whose enrichment program is study abroad? I would like to ask a few questions.
1301;1;https://news.republika.co.id/berita/s7g4ft320/kecewa-pelayanan-kampus-binus-bekasi-orang-tua-mengadu-ke-menteri-nadiem What are your thoughts, everyone\
1302;1;To the person driving the white car inside the Anggrek campus, please do not speed in the campus area. There was a puddle and we got splashed. Thank you... I hope you become more aware.
1303;0;Does anyone know how to sync the Bimay schedule to Outlook?
1304;2;How would you feel if someone who was your junior in middle school suddenly confessed that they used to like you and still do until now? Honestly, I was really shocked… and they even said they would wait for me and my current partner to break up. That is serious.
1305;0;This is my made in heaven!
1306;1;Are the weekly quizzes on Saturdays in SOCS1 mandatory?
1307;1;Has anyone ever been to Beehub? Do you enter like normal, or is there a different procedure?
1308;0;Hello seniors, I am on my way to becoming a Binus Alam Sutera student in 2020.
1309;1;Am I the only one who has not received the class schedule, or is it the same for everyone?
1310;2;Why is it that I always get emotional when I am with my family…? Even the smallest things always manage to irritate me—whether it is my dad, mom, or sibling, it is all the same. But honestly, I am not the kind of person who gets angry easily… do you get what I mean?
1311;2;Flat is justice!!!
1312;1;Please share your experiences if you are currently doing a part-time job, internship, or working from home. Honestly, I am not someone who is active in campus organizations, so I have started looking for internships or part-time jobs, and I am around the middle semesters. Is organizational experience necessary to be accepted by a company even if it is just for an internship? Is it worth trying to apply for an internship even though I am not yet in semester five or above? Please share some tips on how to get accepted
1313;0;Please recommend a boarding house near Binus Syahdan that is still within walking distance, specifically for women—or if it is mixed, at least has separate floors.
1314;2;Yes, I understand the tasks are divided, but that does not mean you can do it carelessly. I still have to fix it again.
1315;1;Have you ever felt so tired, like, “What is the point of fighting for someone who does not want to be fought for? It is all meaningless.”
1316;1;Earlier I went to PIK 2 with my family. Along the way, there were banners showing a Thailand-themed park, and I thought it was already open since it said July. I thought, “Well, they finished the Prayer Park and Batavia PIK pretty fast,” so my parents and I planned to check it out. Halfway there, I noticed there were only one or two cars, mostly project vehicles. It turned out to be really far, we had to drive for an hour past Teluk Naga, Tangerang. And when we finally arrived, it was just an empty plot of land, and there was a giant billboard that said “This park will be built soon.”
1317;2;Have you ever seen a friend who just started trying to act rebellious… but ends up being forced and cringeworthy? At first, we actually wanted to help him gain popularity. But once he started getting some attention, he stepped on others and became full of himself. Honestly, I feel like I want to put him in his place, because this guy—excuse me—is kind of cringey. He is way too aware that he is handsome, but he is completely losing his grounding. He needs to realize that he is not the only good-looking person. If only he had some self-awareness, it would be easy to be friends with him. But like this? No way. I really feel like yelling in his face just to snap him back to reality.
1318;2;So what if you are an atheist? Do you think that makes you cool? If you want people to respect you, then you should also respect those who believe in God.
1319;2;I am so exhausted—the exams never end, and next week I already have a 7 a.m. class as the first session.
1320;1;Sometimes when I look at my boyfriend’s photo, I feel like he is not attractive. I often imagine a scenario where he disappoints me, and I tell myself I must be a strong woman who would leave him. But without realizing it, every time I hear a romantic song, I think of him. When I see a photo he sends, I smile to myself. Every time I find a funny meme, I immediately send it to him. When I watch videos recommending good food places, I put them on my wish list to visit together. I have become a fool because of love.
1321;2;The course I truly did not understand ended up scoring in the 60s, the course I was afraid of got me a score in the 80s, and the one I thought was just okay turned out to be in the 50s... I am confused.
1322;1;Why has the SAT score from the Dig In Himsisfo event not been updated?
1324;1;If we attend a Binus webinar, how long does it usually take for the SAT score to be updated?
1325;2;In the end, I will just be a clown.
1326;0;Do you believe in the benefits of rose quartz and similar things?
1327;1;I do not know, but something seems off in the comment section of the Indonesian language lecturer thread, or is it just me?
1328;1;Is it not time to make peace within ourselves?
1329;0;I laughed so hard seeing my friend’s status—his daily posts are always wild. And today he suddenly posted a story commemorating Isra Mi'raj.
1330;1;If I take the independent study program in semester 6, is it possible to take another internship in semester 7?
1331;1;If I lose everything, stumble, and fall, will you laugh at me?
1332;2;Seeing my friend living such a good life now makes me feel envious. I do not even know what her job is, but within just a month or two she has gone on trips to Bali, Labuan Bajo, Thailand, Singapore, and Jogja. From what I heard from our friends, the job consists only of women and they are provided with accommodation at all those places. Her lifestyle has changed so much. She used to tell stories about having to borrow money just to buy a gift for her boyfriend, working so hard for every little thing. Now she wears fully branded outfits from head to toe. Would you be tempted if you were me, even though I have no idea what her job actually is?
1333;1;Please list the courses whose lecturers have already confirmed that the final exam will be held onsite here, so that everyone can prepare well in advance.
1334;1;Have you ever experienced submitting your exam on the website, but it turns out it was not actually sent? Was it your mistake or the website’s?
1335;2;This is wild. My friend’s boyfriend was taken by a mistress. Now that same mistress is cheating with another guy, and they even did “that” together. And what is ridiculous is that my friend’s ex is still trying to hold on to her.
1336;1;I cry in private, but laugh in public. That is me.
1337;1;So you women have settled for a man who is only good at texting? Do not trust those kinds of tricks, these men can be very deceptive, you know.
1338;1;If someone gets sick, what is the procedure? I think I might have COVID but I am afraid that if I state it in the health declaration form, I will not be allowed to attend classes. Will it be switched to online?
1339;0;I am selling books that are still in very good condition. Where can I sell them?
1340;1;When talking to an ex, what are some nice topics to discuss? Any suggestions?
1341;2;Binus, please do not change the start date of Semester 4 suddenly. Have some consideration for students coming from out of town and those who have already planned vacations on those dates.
1342;1;Even Rexona can stay loyal at all times. Why can’t you?
1343;1;I am clearly asking for trouble. I only ate at 8 p.m. today, and now I am complaining about my ulcer acting up.
1344;1;My Instagram story only lasts for 24 hours. He was born just to be seen by you, so please take a look.
1345;2;So this is what it feels like to be late in submitting. I only had to upload it, and it would have been done. But the time ran out. I am so stupid, seriously.
1346;1;I feel jealous of those friendship circles where everyone is good-looking, smart, and close-knit.
1347;0;For those in B26 whose SAT score is already above 120, aside from me, who else is there? Please raise your hand.
1348;2;Hey, do you think we can still be together even though our music tastes are so different? I tried listening to the mixtape you gave me, but I honestly did not enjoy it.
1349;2;I feel so conflicted after stalking my dad (I already knew he remarried, and yes, my mom and he are divorced). When I saw his new family photos, I could not even explain how I felt—sad, maybe, but it is hard to describe. I am actually fine with him getting remarried, as long as he still fulfills his duties as a father. But even giving me one million rupiah a month requires me to beg him. Meanwhile, his younger child from his new wife goes to an international school. I mean, it is okay, but does it not seem unfair that only my mother is struggling so hard to support me, while he walks away from his responsibilities? That is why I do not care anymore what excuses he gives—whether he says he is sick or broke—I will keep asking him for what he owes, because I am just disappointed. He keeps saying he does not have money, then sends me a screenshot of his BCA bank balance, but I know he has another bank account. I used to always say, “It is okay, Dad, if you do not have money now, just do not forget next month.” But after I found out everything about his new family, I no longer know how I feel. Now I really have no empathy or pity for him at all, no matter if he is sick or anything. Do you think I am being cruel? Please be honest, I truly cannot judge myself. Sorry for the long story.
1350;2;How do you convince strict parents? It seems really difficult, does it not?
1351;2;It has been a few months and I have felt completely unmotivated. I have not done anything, whether studying or hobbies. I just want to sleep all the time. I used to enjoy playing games or drawing, but now I have no mood at all to do the two things I used to love.
1352;2;Because of the coronavirus, some companies are struggling financially. The parents who are supposed to pay for their children’s needs are also facing difficulties. Maybe that is why some parents end up arguing with their children. That is why there are so many complaints about payment. It is frustrating. It really is different for those whose parents are wealthy—money seems to just grow on trees for them.
1353;2;I just want to make my parents happy. Is that something so difficult to be granted? I just want a smooth life—university that goes well, not necessarily graduating with honors, but graduating as the best version of myself. I want to get an internship without too much difficulty, get exam scores that are not perfect but enough to pass, and find a job in a comfortable place where I can work without feeling burdened. Is such a simple life so difficult to attain? I do not care if my wishes are hard to fulfill, as long as my basic needs in life are always met without having to worry about tomorrow or even the future. God, please tell me—is that kind of life truly so difficult to be granted?
1354;0;Please let us go fully onsite so I can meet my crush every day.
1355;1;Binus Anggrek is so cold. I have been shivering in class this whole time.
1356;1;I am starting to feel bored with him. At the same time, there is another guy getting close to me, and he seems more fun. My boyfriend and I go to different universities. What do you think?
1357;2;There is a guy who seems to have a crush on me (I also like him back). We used to chat every day. But for the past two days, we have stopped chatting. However, when we met yesterday, we still acted as usual, and he even patted my head more often than before. But we have already stopped chatting. What do you think that means?
1358;2;Why is West Sumatra abbreviated as SUMBAR? Because if not revealed, it would be like our relationship that remains hidden.
1359;1;I did not expect people to actually start dating online through Zoom.
1360;0;I just realized that Binus LMS is the best compared to other universities. Especially with the new feature updates, although it still often has errors. Keep up the good work, IT division of Binus.
1361;0;What is going on with the revealing clothing at Binus lately? It sounds interesting.
1362;1;I feel like I have friends, but when I join them while they are going out, they are fine with it. Yet they never directly invite me themselves.
1363;1;Hi, I miss you, but it seems like you do not miss me. That is okay. I hope you are doing well.
1364;1;I feel so frustrated looking at the Binusfess account on Twitter. Were they not briefed for the midterms or taught how to reference properly?
1365;0;---------------
1366;0;For the senior students in computer science, does semester 4 involve a lot of group projects?
1367;2;That is such a clear red flag.
1368;1;I really want to break free, to free myself from something. I feel trapped, but I do not even know what I am trapped in anymore.
1369;1;It feels like I want to leave, but I do not have the courage to let go. It feels like I am trying to stay, but my heart no longer feels at ease.
1370;2;What is wrong with my schedule? My classes are overlapping between Syahdan and Anggrek. Should I split myself like an amoeba?
1371;1;Hello, fellow Sunibians. For next semester’s classes, are you choosing online or onsite?
1372;0;Has anyone ever had an individual final project? If so, which course was it for?
1373;0;Hello seniors, please help us by filling out this questionnaire for our project this semester https://forms.gle/aVyEHkKacBu4EaV97 Thank you to those who have already filled it out.
1374;1;"To all friends from Sunibcurhat, it would be best to resolve this issue in a family-like manner. As Binusians, we should uphold togetherness. Do not take matters into your own hands, do not accuse each other. Just forgive one another. The new year is approaching; let us not continue to fight. It is embarrassing. That is all from me, thank you. Greetings from Binusian 2009"
1375;0;It felt so good to be mentioned by my crush. It was amazing.
1376;1;I was bored during the online class, so I made popcorn. But it turned out the lecturer was explaining an assignment. The Zoom audio was overpowered by the sound of the popcorn.
1377;1;Young people who like listening to songs from the 1970s to 1990s, which can be considered old-fashioned—do you think that kind of taste is too old and outdated?
1378;2;Back then when I thought “all men are the same,” you said “not all men are like that, I would never leave you like that.” And I believed you. But now? You are the one who made me feel again that all men are the same.
1379;1;Earlier this afternoon, my head and body felt like they were shaking. I thought it was an earthquake. Apparently, it was not. I was just feeling unwell due to low blood pressure. But then I saw the news and it turned out there really was an earthquake. I just realized I am currently in Surabaya, not in Jakarta, so I did not feel it. By the way, my condolences to the victims of the earthquake. I sincerely apologize for not being able to send aid to the disaster location yet. But if I have the chance, I will donate whatever I can.
1380;1;They said it would be fully onsite, but why are all other subjects fully onsite while my entrepreneurship class is still fully online?
1381;0;https://sunibcurhat.com/secret/JTNr2K
1382;2;This circle of friends is truly toxic.
1383;1;If the exam is onsite later, I would be fine with it as long as I can choose the time. I tend to feel groggy and unable to think clearly in the morning. My brain only works properly at night.
1384;1;Guys, if you are too lazy or do not have time to submit your exam, just try to submit it no matter what, so you do not have to retake the course. If you truly cannot do it or are too lazy, then maybe just hire someone to do it rather than leave it blank and risk having to retake it. In my opinion, retaking a course is a waste of money and time. Do you agree?
1385;0;Does anyone already have the academic calendar for the even semester?
1386;1;Do we have to fill out the lecturer evaluation questionnaire? Will the lecturers be able to see our responses?
1387;1;A lot of people say “your face is funny” — do they think I am a clown?
1388;2;My friends have already dropped this midterm, and in the end, I did too because I stayed up late working on it.
1389;0;................
1390;1;To the senior guy from Binus TV, during the 10th Talk yesterday in the auditorium, we accidentally bumped into each other. I just want to say sorry.
1391;0;My account keeps getting auto-debited, damn
1392;1;My friend had a wet dream in the middle of the day, and somehow I was in that dream, and then he told me about it.
1393;0;Do you all know or have you heard of Bossman Mardigu?
1394;2;Please, Binus. The report from chapter 1 to 3 must be at least 15 pages, even for the independent study track, which is not that different from regular campus classes. Even for an actual internship, they still require a minimum of 15 pages. What is the point? It ends up just being used to wrap fried snacks. Sure, some of the results are stored on campus (although not always), but where do the printed and scribbled-on copies go? They just get thrown away.
1395;0;I want to be hugged all day
1396;0;Do not forget to be grateful today!
1397;2;What? Graduation 67 will be held at Sentul International Convention Center?
1398;1;Does anyone else feel like it is not right that after the orientation committee ended and we moved to Discord, it suddenly became really quiet?
1399;2;I took a 100-minute onsite final exam and my butt was already hurting from sitting on a wooden chair. What about next semester if we have two sessions = 200 minutes? Please upgrade, tuition fees are already very expensive.
1400;1;Wait, wait, wait... I received a 100% scholarship when I first entered Binus (a discount of about 30 million rupiah, I think), but I still paid around 17 million. What was that for?
1401;2;Where do you usually look for internships? I am confused about where else I should apply.
1402;1;How are the drivers of cars and motorcycles in Bekasi? I am not sure if I should bring my car or just use public transportation to go there
1403;1;Is the user with the name ntzn single?
1404;2;I am really annoyed with people who are in the group but only read messages. What are they thinking? Do they think only reading makes them look cool, or busy, or something? What is the point? Why act so distant with your own friends? Think a little. When someone is reaching out, it should be replied to. To everyone who is in a group chat, please do not ignore your friends. Whatever the message is, being left on read hurts. And to my new online friend: you know who you are.
1405;2;You said you are no longer ****** but in reality, you still are. Typical women.
1406;1;Is it okay if I do not attend the welcoming party?
1407;0;My blanket smells like you, damn.
1408;1;Suddenly there is an onsite class, and I do not even have a Flazz card yet.
1409;1;All you young wild girls, you are messing me up.
1410;2;Why does my younger sibling want to stay at the Wisma Atlet? I think they are starting to lose it...
1411;0;Why do most members of the military always look for a partner who works as a nurse?
1412;2;I really miss my old house before we moved, but I can never visit it. I can only look at it through Google Maps.
1413;1;Is it no longer possible to suggest jobs on the enrichment website?
1414;0;Let us check in here—who enjoys working part-time as a barista or anything else (please mention the job)?
1415;1;Hoping for nothing in return does not mean I was hoping to be treated badly.
1416;0;Is there any place to play billiards near Binus Kemanggisan?
1417;1;Tell us what your fetishes are.
1418;2;The Binusmaya mobile app is really terrible. When I want to check my GPA and Finance on Bimob, it always redirects me to the new app, but the new app does not even provide the data. Even if it does, I have to say the user experience is very bad. As a female student (me), it is so complicated and confusing just to access basic information. Thankfully, I am already in my final semester. I cannot imagine being a new student and having to actively use this app—I would have high blood pressure already.
1419;1;Admin, if possible, please just ban D's IP address so they cannot make another account again.
1420;1;It is better to show off your parents’ money than to show off your partner’s money.
1421;2;"Speaking of vaccine certificates; at Sunib there is a study abroad program, right? Well, my immune cells have already done their own research on foreign viruses. The viruses and the vaccines were imported, not local. That should be enough, no more enrichment needed."
1422;0;Does anyone know who created sunibcurhat?
1423;2;At this age, is it still possible to get taller? All of my friends are over 170 cm tall, and it makes me feel insecure.
1424;1;After an interview, if there is no further contact, does that mean I was not accepted?
1425;2;How do you get a friendly girl, sir and ma’am?
1426;1;I tried to maintain a healthy lifestyle by not sleeping too late, and earlier I went to bed at 8 p.m., but I woke up at 11 p.m. for no reason and could not fall back asleep.
1427;1;Back in my first semester, I was the type who dressed casually, was not neat, did not wear makeup, and did not wear perfume. My friends at the time happened to be all male. One day, we were walking, and a girl passed by—she smelled nice, looked neat, and wore makeup. Then my friend commented, “Girls who pass by smelling good and looking neat are nice to look at. You do not even have any scent and look messy.” That did not happen just once, but several times. Maybe for those of you who do not care about appearance, you might think, why even respond, it is our right. Well, in this case, if you often
1428;0;I like to compliment people instinctively when a friend shows me their photo. This afternoon, I instinctively said, “Wow, you look so good,” and they got flustered and even pushed me. I laughed so hard… The fun part about giving instinctive compliments is that people always get flustered.
1429;0;Hello everyone, next week I plan to try the gym for the first time. Do you have any tips for me about using the gym equipment?
1430;1;At the office, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. feels really fast. But from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. feels extremely slow.
1431;1;When I stay at home, I feel bored. When I go to campus, I feel tired. So what should I do?
1432;2;Why does Binus make everything so difficult? I am in my fifth semester and I want to join the Kampus Merdeka program, but I am not allowed to. My friends from other universities are given the freedom to join. It is honestly embarrassing to say that Binus does not allow it. Back then, before the Kampus Merdeka program existed, the 3+1 program was something Binus was proud of. But now? Even getting an internship through Binus is more difficult than at other universities. As long as they get the money first, they do not care about student matters anymore.
1433;0;[Reminder] Choose Your Own Courses!
1434;2;Please tell me the steps for enrichment registration. I want to help my older sibling.
1435;0;Good luck to everyone who will take the Artificial Intelligence exam on-site tomorrow.
1436;2;Keep coding until I drop dead.
1437;0;https://www.haxball.com/play Let us play together.
1438;0;I am curious, if a post gets a lot of dislikes, will there be any consequences? Please try to DISLIKE this post as much as possible.
1439;0;Everyone, may I ask what the email address of SSC Kemanggisan is?
1440;0;Falling in love is not like falling from a tomato tree.
1441;1;Hey, the requirement says a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 150 words. Is it allowed to write more than that? Because it feels strange to stop right in the middle.
1442;1;Is it just me or has Binus been quite disorganized this semester in handling the courses? From unclear schedules to events that are said to be mandatory but come with no explanation. It is very difficult for those of us from out of town to plan things when everything from the university is unclear.
1443;2;Please share the answers for Beelingua English A2.2, everyone.
1444;1;I want to cry first.
1445;0;Hello everyone, our group needs respondents for a survey for our Software Engineering course assignment. Thank you for your time. https://forms.gle/CREDKKr4LN6Vi8nM8 Please help fill it out.
1447;0;Please invite Fujii Kaze, JVKE, and NewJeans to HITC this year so that I will not miss the chance to attend the concert.
1448;1;Dear Binus, if you want to conduct on-site examinations, we are ready to accept it. On-site exams are indeed more difficult, but we will still be prepared.
1449;1;I bought smashed fried chicken, but the chicken was not even smashed. That is ridiculous.
1450;1;I was made to feel comfortable, then left just like that, and it turns out they got back with their ex. Thank you for everything.
1451;1;Excuse me, Computer Science seniors, may I ask for your advice on how to catch up with the material until the sorting topic? My online judge scores keep turning red because I cannot solve them. I feel very insecure compared to those who are good at coding.
1452;1;Why do people with fair skin like to say 'oh no, I look darker now'? What do they mean by that, darker from which part? You do know how to distinguish colors, right?
1453;1;And please allow me to hold you just this once.
1454;1;How do you differentiate between getting close to someone and being in a situationship?
1455;1;Will there be a review session for the final exam later?
1456;1;Has Binus not changed its mind? COVID cases are rising again. I often hear from friends at other campuses (LSP*) that their classes are moved online because every week there is always at least one student who tests positive for COVID
1457;2;Is it not frustrating when you make plans far in advance, but then on the actual day they cancel? Like, what on earth?
1458;1;This time last year we were still on a video call until dawn during Ramadan
1459;1;What reflects my feelings for her now is that in the past, it was like a tight knot—really strong and could not be undone even if it hurt. But now it is like a ribbon. I still want us to be together, but if she chooses to walk away, I will not stop her. Because I do not want her to stay out of obligation. Love should grow naturally, not because it is forced. I am grateful that through this, I came to know that you have the same feelings and hopes as I do. Let it flow, just do our best, and hopefully, it ends the way we both hope.
1460;1;Ji Pyeong being sad makes me want to cry. He should just be with me so he can be a happy man instead.
1461;0;Coca-Cola... Coca-Colaaa..
1462;1;I quit SunCur, it is getting boring.
1463;1;I am quite shocked that some of my high school friends are already engaged, married, or even have kids. I know everyone has a different path, but it is still shocking.
1464;1;How nice, my friend already got help with assignments, yet still had the nerve to gossip.
1465;1;Why does time seem to pass so quickly when we are busy or have activities, but feel so slow when we are doing nothing?
1466;2;want to grow my nails long, but I like playing the guitar
1467;2;How are you still this useless, brother?
1468;1;There is one subject I have that is only worth one credit, and it has no midterm or final exam. So why do the girls get an average score of 85-90 while the guys only get 80-85? Do girls pay more for their tuition than guys? Why are their grades higher? I know the difference is small, only 5 to 10 points, but it still feels unfair, especially if the scores are based on group work and the girls did not even contribute at all
1469;0;Usually, when someone dies and their body is not complete, their spirit will wander and ask to be made whole again.
1470;2;Please, classmates, if someone asks something in the group chat, respond to it. If you do not know, then just say you do not know. Do not just ignore them!
1471;1;Stayed up late working on RMCS, now it is time to stay up again to prepare for Eid
1472;2;For those of you who complain about bad lab grades.That is why you should do the exercises properly, I pay attention when I teach. If you take it easy on me, I will take it easy on your grade. Put in some effort!
1473;1;Looking for someone to make a good PowerPoint presentation for me.
1474;1;Why do people who buy ice cream at McDonald's turn it upside down like that? Or is it actually a menu innovation?
1475;1;The older I get, the more socially withdrawn I become.
1476;1;Does anyone have information about upcoming seminars that offer student activity points? I really need one more.
1477;2;Sooner or later, I have to learn to put on makeup… but since my skin is rough and I have a lot of acne, I am honestly scared. But it is okay, I cannot wait until my skin is completely clear. Has anyone else experienced this?
1478;1;What kind of Instagram stories do you like to watch? I want to start posting more on my main account, but I do not know what to post.
1479;1;Next semester I will not be in the same class as my crush. What should I do, everyone?
1480;1;When someone else does something wrong, you want their identity to be exposed, but when it happens to you, you call it 'doxxing'... Sure thing, buddy
1481;2;When is the deadline to protest grades? Can I still do it tomorrow?
1482;1;Who here cannot comfort others when they are venting? Me!
1483;1;Currently at the stage where I want to finish midterms quickly, but I lose motivation while working on them
1484;1;The thing is, my head is so unclear, so many thoughts blurring my eyes which makes me really uncomfortable
1485;0;Good night, my angel. Rest peacefully over there. Haha.
1486;2;If a guy says he does not want to date because he is not financially stable, is that just an excuse for me to give up on him, or what? Because he clearly knows I like him. We have also had a few deep conversations late at night over calls, and I feel really comfortable with him, even though we have not known each other for a full month. His personality also makes me feel at ease. For your information, everyone, he is not the type to be a player. He also said it is okay to stay friends and keep calling, but I do not want that, because if I fall deeper for him, it would be bad. Besides, I have already decided to step back. Is that wrong? No, right? Time to move on!
1487;1;I want to ask, can the Binusian Flazz card be used to pay for KRL, JakLingko, and so on?
1488;1;Everyone, I want to ask something. I have a two-day meeting for a work-related event. Can I still fill in my student activity attendance online? Please give me the information. Thank you so much!
1489;1;Why do we have to pay for competitions? I cannot help but shake my head when I see it.
1490;1;Has anyone here not gotten an internship placement yet?
1491;0;How much budget is needed for a two-day trip to Singapore, including round-trip tickets and accommodation?
1492;2;I want to add a new submission but Bimay has been very slow since yesterday. I am tired of waiting, but I still cannot submit. I have to keep repeating it, and it feels like this will continue until the pandemic ends.
1493;0;Can someone give a recommendation for looking for a boarding house or apartment? Do you have any suggestions on which app to use?
1494;1;Is the new Bisanara experiencing an error right now?
1495;2;It is really better to be alone. I do not care about friends who only show up when they have problems, especially those related to their dramatic love lives like an Indosiar soap opera. When I have a problem, they say they are busy and have no time. That is so frustrating.
1496;1;Damn, I missed class again.
1497;0;Computer Technology, here we go.
1498;1;My friend wants to cosplay as Kirito at Impacnation on July 31. I do not know whether to feel proud or embarrassed.
1499;2;"There is this girl from my class. At first, I talked to her spontaneously without any intention. After that, she often started conversations with me. Her tone is very gentle, and sometimes she asks about things outside of college. When there are group assignments, she always wants to be in the same group as me. Sometimes she even calls me. What is going on? I am afraid she might like me, but I do not like her. I am scared of hurting her feelings. But if I ask, ""Do you like me?"" that would sound very weird."
1500;2;Please, how do you write Object-Oriented Programming code on paper?
1501;1;Lately I enjoy wearing a white shirt with a sweater on top. Please tell me, is it weird if the shirt used to be my school uniform?
1502;0;Finally became Male 19.
1503;1;Elite university, but Bimay makes things difficult for students.
1504;0;Is the standard double room at Binus Square (for two people) recommended? I mean the one in West Jakarta.
1505;1;Wait... there is a class on Saturday? I have not had a class on Saturday for a long time. Why not move it to Friday instead?
1506;1;Have fun overthinking.
1507;1;Is anyone joining the Blackpink ticket war?
1508;0;What do we need to bring for the operating systems exam?
1509;1;Sometimes I get really annoyed with people who take days to reply to messages without any explanation. And in the end, they just leave my question on read. They act like they are busier than the president.
1510;2;I cannot even understand what is going on in regular classes. How am I supposed to learn anything in online classes? I feel like I am becoming stupid.
1511;1;Every day I keep checking Outlook to see whether I have been accepted by an internship company or not.
1512;1;After what happened last night, I no longer trust women. How can we sincerely give, but they only accept not because they need it, but because they want to take advantage of us?
1513;1;Father: Why go to college if you are not happy? You should change your major. I just want you to be happy. Me: Dad, if being happy was that simple, I would have dropped out in second grade. It is not that I hate college, I just do not enjoy math or memorization. Honestly, I am lazy, but life cannot be based on laziness. It is time for me to learn responsibility. Father: (thumbs up)
1514;1;This house believes that people who dislike mint and matcha are weak individuals.
1515;1;Classes are mostly online, internships are work-from-home, and all my friends are girls... Oh no, how am I supposed to get a girlfriend like this?
1516;0;Guys, please recommend some movies in the family, comedy, action, or sci-fi genre on HBO so that I have other reasons to watch besides just watching Euphoria.
1517;1;It is sad that I downloaded so many dating apps, but when I finally get a match, they are all weird. Just getting a match feels like a miracle.
1518;1;Does anyone also have a Capstone project due before Christmas?
1519;1;Sorry if this sounds silly, but does the grade from the first semester midterms have a big impact on future grades? Like on GPA or something?
1520;1;I already paid Binus last Thursday through e-banking. I also sent an email about the transfer, and Binus replied last Saturday saying they would check and confirm. But until now, I still cannot take the exam. I have to wait for SSC to open, but I am already panicking.
1521;1;People with the initial R are really unsettling, right?
1522;1;I want to go on a staycation with my partner. Do you have any tips on how to ask for permission from my parents? By the way, we usually do video calls or phone calls around two to three times a day.
1523;2;One day, you will feel what I am feeling right now, and then you will understand why I am like this. It really hurts.
1524;0;Please comment, how much is the average monthly allowance of a Binus student?
1525;1;Without me, you are nothing.
1526;2;Wow, the break from the even to the odd semester is two months. Why is it not three months?
1527;1;It is alright to be a loser today, as long as I become a winner tomorrow.
1528;0;Are there any Genshin Impact players here? Please share your UID, I want to make new friends.
1529;0;Guys, I need a financial calculator for the midterm on the 18th. If anyone is willing to lend me one, please comment, and I will send you a message.
1530;1;Seriously, we only ever chat to talk about assignments.
1531;1;Has anyone ever applied to become an iBuddy? Is it difficult to get accepted? Thank you.
1532;1;I am tired, but what else can I do..
1533;0;I dreamt of being hugged last night. It felt good. Thank you, dream.
1534;2;How do you ask for permission from your parents to live in a boarding house so that they will allow it? Honestly, I do not feel comfortable staying at home all the time, especially during college like this..
1535;1;I call her babe, but she calls me bro.
1536;2;Good luck on the Computer Technology final exam, everyone. I hope you all get good grades, amen.
1537;1;Am I the only one who often feels like the kitchen can smell really bad, like something rotten? Sometimes it is really strange. Why can it be like that? (5th floor)
1538;1;Do not worry, you are being loved madly by me. I even love you more than I love myself. That is what I said to the woman who brought me peace, even though I am not the one she needs.
1539;1;Never mind, I already found out. Just ignore it.
1540;1;Yesterday it still said 18, female. Now it already says 19, female.
1541;2;I feel like I want to turn back time. The signs were already there from the beginning, so why did I just realize it now? On the other hand, I do not want to be delusional, but based on the signs from Google, 80-90% match the characteristics that indicate she has a crush on me. What should I do now?
1542;2;To the student with the initials A and ending with L, please pay your debt of 350 thousand plus 50 thousand, a total of 400 thousand! It has been almost 9 months! No wonder many people are annoyed with you!
1543;0;Happy celebration of the Ascension of Jesus Christ. May the Lord Jesus bless you.
1544;1;Why are so many people complaining about parking fees? As far as I know, for motorcycles, no matter how long, the maximum fee is four thousand rupiah. But I am not sure how the system works for cars.
1545;2;That is crazy. There is no more DHD, and now one session is 100 minutes. So for example, if there used to be two credits at the same time, now it is really split into two sessions (200 minutes).
1546;2;"Me: ""I wish the registration for onsite classes would open again."" Also me right now after being messaged by SSC that onsite classes are open again: ""Hmm... should I register... but I feel a bit lazy..."" Typical me."
1547;2;"I am extremely tired. There are so many deadlines coming up, and they said all the final exams will be offline. I feel a bit pressured as a fifth semester student. At first I thought, ""Ah, every semester is the same,"" but no, it really is this exhausting."
1548;2;Expensive tuition fees, but opening PowerPoint files on Newbinusmaya is difficult.
1549;1;I feel like skipping class during the research methods lesson because the lecturer's mood is unpredictable.
1550;2;Why is my class always LA01? Semester 1: LA01, Semester 2: LA01, Semester 3: LA01, Semester 4: LA01. I feel like I am eternally in LA01.
1551;2;Is Binus not planning to provide a shuttle bus for students who often use public transportation or live in housing areas around Green Sedayu? How can the facilities be worse than those at universities ranked below Binus?
1552;1;Is it allowed for a Christian to marry a Catholic?
1553;1;It must have been love, but it is over now.
1554;0;What does flexing mean?
1555;1;For those in semester 7 who are taking their thesis but still have not submitted the softcover until now, where are you?
1556;2;CBL CBL CBL I am extremely tired.
1557;1;Does anyone want to play Valorant together? All my gaming
1558;2;Nowadays, every time I go out, even after disinfecting everything, taking a shower twice after coming home, and spraying my belongings many times with disinfectant, I still feel extremely paranoid.
1559;2;Sometimes I am confused by people who ask about our ideal type. When asked about that, of course everyone would want someone perfect. Even if you only mention a few traits like wanting someone beautiful, of the same faith, tall, kind, fair-skinned, with a sharp nose — is that all? Do you not want a smart partner? Do you not want someone wealthy? Do you not want someone loyal who would not betray you? Do you not want someone who accepts you just the way you are?
1560;1;Friends, I need some advice. So, one of my team members is willing to do the tasks when divided, but during discussions, every time I ask something, no one responds. For example, when I was working on Google Form questions and got confused about what to ask, I asked in the group, but no one replied. What should I do to deal with this?
1561;1;We have already said we love each other, held hands, walked arm in arm, but our status is just friends. That is truly ridiculous.
1562;2;"Have you ever finished eating and then were told to eat again? Then, after that, they say ""why are you so fat?"" But if you slim down, they say ""why are you so skinny?"" That is so frustrating."
1563;1;Crossing out friends who do not contribute in a group is not that easy, remember that, people of SunibCurhat.
1564;0;I do not need a map or GPS, because when I am with you, I already know where I want to go.
1565;1;I have experienced something like this before, but in the version where I had to speak Mandarin.
1566;2;I would like to ask, for those who got the CB course last even semester, how were the conserve hours? Did they appear? I am very confused since the grades have been out for a while, but the hours are still not showing up.
1567;2;Everyone, I would like to ask, does anyone know of any active groups where I can share my research questionnaire and get help in filling it out?
1568;1;Just sad for no reason
1569;0;I will go back to admiring my fictional crush.
1570;2;Are there any seat recommendations at Binus to avoid being called on by the lecturer?
1571;2;Why is SunibCurhat not accessible on laptops or PCs?
1572;1;When you brush your teeth, do you also brush your tongue?
1573;0;Happy Teacher's Day to all lecturers.
1574;2;Oh no, why does my body feel unwell during midterm weeks? I want to do my midterms, but my eyes and head hurt so much.
1575;2;I stayed up late for three days in a row for the midterms. And it is still not finished. I might as well give up.
1576;1;What do you think about Binus going fully onsite while COVID cases are rising again? I would like to know your opinions.
1577;1;I feel like putting a note on each midterm answer: Note: I apologize in advance if the answers are not perfect due to the tight schedule, including quizzes, video conferences, forums, assignments, and midterms all happening in the same week, which made us overwhelmed. Not to mention the projects waiting to be completed. Please understand that this is not our fault. That is all, and thank you.
1578;1;Does Binus have holidays during the fasting month?
1579;1;I wish he knew that I liked him
1580;2;I feel really overwhelmed right now, because there are so many assignments, but I have no motivation to do them. Everything seems difficult to me. But if I do not do it, I will keep thinking about it. Yet my body refuses to move and do the work. It is all so confusing and frustrating.
1581;2;Independent study is not the same as an internship, right?
1582;0;We pay expensive tuition fees at Binus only to end up learning through YouTube. I really love it so much.
1583;1;Am I the only one who has ever eaten in the toilet?
1584;2;Reading the news on Twitter lately has made me even more afraid of living in this country.
1585;2;Can someone share a message format for contacting a lecturer to confirm a final project topic? Also, when is the appropriate time to message a lecturer during the holiday weeks like this? Please help.
1586;0;Oh God, please give me strength in front of the handsome, well-built men at Sunib.

1589;2;My financial situation is difficult. I want to rent a room, but I feel bad asking for money. Commuting is also exhausting because the distance is so far.
1590;1;Have you ever felt like you still cannot move on, but at the same time you know deep down that getting back together will never happen?

1592;1;Female, 16 years old — someone said that there was a suicide at Binus Kemanggisan. Is it true that it happened today because the SOCS midterm was too difficult?
1593;2;Ah, I feel so dizzy and overwhelmed.
1594;1;Some people might be atheists because they feel that believing in God contradicts science or logic. But in reality, not only is science compatible with the existence of God, studying science more deeply can actually strengthen one’s faith, from evolution to the origin of the universe.
1595;1;Why is it that I cannot do anything useful this weekend, even though the midterms are coming up?
1596;2;I really like this course, but the lecturer explains everything verbally during class and does not use the PowerPoint slides provided by Binus. Sir, I need the visual explanation too, not just verbal explanations. I feel overwhelmed. What he explains is actually meaningful, but I still do not understand, Sir.
1597;1;If I cannot log into the TFI website, who should I contact? It says to contact the administrator, but does anyone know the contact information? Thank you.
1598;1;Oh my goodness, Secondmedia, the maintenance is estimated to last until tomorrow. I am currently taking exams.
1599;2;I have noticed that many extroverted people are often rude to introverted ones. Many of them say things like, “Why are you so quiet?” and so on. Why are we always the ones expected to talk more? Why do you not just stay quiet instead? It is so annoying how they keep blaming introverted personalities.
1600;1;When you feel tired from studying, just look at the finance section on Bimay to see how much of your parents' money you have spent.
1601;2;When your partner leaves the game you used to play together, it really hurts.
1602;1;What do you all think about the final exam questions for the Information System Data Mining course?
1603;2;This is crazy, guys. My friend’s partner was taken by a homewrecker. And now that woman is cheating with another man, and they even did inappropriate things. The funny thing is, my friend is still trying to hold on to that homewrecker.
1604;1;What is this GIS final exam question even about?
1605;0;I offer my life to You, Lord. For Your glory. I give this life as an offering that is pleasing to You.
1606;2;For those who got entrepreneurship: market validation, what will we do in the first meeting after the midterms? I am really scared that we will be asked to do a presentation.
1607;1;In my personal opinion, guys who wear crop tops are deliberately trying to be the center of attention.
1608;2;Why do I look so terrible today when I am going out with my current partner, even though I looked so handsome yesterday when I went out with my ex? Oh no!
1609;2;Why is it so difficult for me to ask for help?
1610;2;The intersection at Rawa Belong is always jammed. It is so annoying.
1611;2;To all the seniors who have experience writing their thesis, I would like to ask: Did you take a part-time or freelance job while working on your thesis, or did you fully focus on it? Which one is better? And if it does not interfere with the thesis, what kind of part-time or freelance job would be suitable? I would really appreciate your advice and guidance.
1612;1;How do I fill in the course registration system? Why is it not working even though I already filled it out last month?
1613;2;If the course is something like algorithms, data structures, or anything related to my field, I can be extremely ambitious and perfectionist. But entrepreneurship? I am already happy with a score of 80 or 85. I am going to do the bare minimum for that. I do not understand why my friend is so ambitious about it.
1614;2;"Yes, I am overweight. I have tried as hard as I could to lose weight through exercise and managing my diet, but it has not worked. I know this is foolish, but I have been forcing myself to vomit what I eat for almost two years. What happened? I did not lose weight; instead, my stomach got injured. I just want to be loved like everyone else, to be close to someone without feeling insecure about my body. Can all of you stop saying, “You have to diet, you have to be thin to get a partner”? I have tried everything and nothing works. I am exhausted."
1615;0;Happy New Year, everyone. I hope this year all our matters are made easier. For those who will take enrichment programs, I wish you success. For those seeking internships, I hope you find one soon. For the freshmen and second-year students, I hope you get good GPAs. And for those writing their theses, I hope you can graduate on time, as soon as possible. Amen.
1616;2;Please share tips for getting an internship. I still have not found one.
1617;2;Why do attractive girls automatically have partners? So where is the one for me?
1618;0;Give me one man and I promise I will make a thousand men catch feelings. Reply below.
1619;2;What a way to end the year. Still, thank you for all the memories. Now, you are just somebody that I used to know. However, you were an obstacle to my academic and career path, and I cannot forgive that. You ignored my warning, and I am glad you are finally gone. It was good while it lasted, but I am even happier knowing that we are now strangers again.
1620;2;I am so tired.
1621;1;I used to really want to attend classes onsite, but now that I actually have them, I feel so lazy.
1622;1;In the middle of midterm exams and suddenly given an assignment with a deadline of only three days. I am so stressed.
1623;2;I used to be an extrovert until junior high school, when something happened that turned me into an almost extreme introvert. Fortunately, I then found myself becoming extroverted again, almost out of control, to the point where I struggled to manage myself. Eventually, I became introverted again in almost every aspect of my life, especially after the painful experience related to my father's role. Now, I feel like I am living for only one thing and one place. I hope I can still be in that place.
1624;1;If you do not have a friend circle, then introduce yourself to the people around you. Do not just stand there quietly like a non-playable character.
1625;2;I am so tired of being told by my parents to find a partner, just so I would not stay in my room all the time. You do not need to tell me—I already know that myself.
1626;2;Honestly, this is partly my fault because I posted my midterm project on my story (I am a visual communication design major), but I did not expect my friend to copy it for their own assignment. They said it was unintentional and informed me that their concept was based on mine—at least, that is what they said. I hope they change their mind before submitting it.
1627;1;When did you realize that most of the knowledge drilled into your head turned out to be not that useful in real life?
1628;1;When a guy is trying to approach you, what makes you, as a girl, lose interest?
1629;2;Oh no, I fell asleep. If the Zoom class started at 09.20 and I just joined at 09.48, is it still okay for attendance? This is the first time I have done this.
1630;2;Guys, if you are annoyed with a group member who does not contribute to the work, just keep playing “I KNEW YOU WERE TROUBLE – Taylor Swift” over and over again!
1631;1;Guys, for those of you who take notes in binders, do you use a new binder every semester or combine it with materials from previous semesters?
1632;0;Santa, tell me if you are really there. Do not make me fall in love again If she will not be here next year.
1633;1;When you are stressed, does it affect your appetite? Lately, because I have been thinking about my internship and final exams, I just do not feel like eating. Even when I eat, it is only because someone tells me to.
1634;1;So you actually care about my health, do you? You are willing not to read or reply to my messages, and maybe you are even chatting with someone else, so that I can turn off my phone and go to sleep earlier. Thank you.
1635;2;Why is it that when foreigners walk by or want to buy something, the sellers are so welcoming, speak politely, and say thank you repeatedly? But when it is me, they are not as welcoming and speak rather harshly. Are they considered more respectable? Or does the shop seem cooler when foreigners shop there? Does this only happen in Indonesia?
1636;1;What should be included in the final presentation for the Pancasila Character Building activity?
1637;2;Tomorrow I want to join the protest, but my friend’s father is a member of the parliament. Now this is quite a dilemma.
1638;1;Love is like mathematics — it can be added, divided, and subtracted.
1639;2;Seriously, doing group assignments is nice when the members are cooperative. But in this case, they are extremely hard to reach and do not contribute at all. If you are not serious about studying, maybe you should not go to college. You are only making things harder for those who are genuinely committed.
1640;1;I do not have any friends from college that I can truly consider as friends — at most, just acquaintances. All of my real friends are from high school. But now, one by one, they have started their own lives. We used to call every night, chat every day, and hang out every week, but now that is all gone. At first, I felt happy for them, but eventually, I started feeling sad for myself.
1641;2;I am a student living far from home and I miss home so much. Please help.
1642;0;How much budget is needed for a two-day trip to Singapore? Including round-trip tickets and accommodation?
1643;1;Can anyone recommend a place to wait between classes around Kemanggisan? I have a four-hour gap every Monday and it feels too far to go home. I want to go to a friend’s place but I do not have any friends around.
1644;1;If a guy asks you out four times, does that mean he likes you? Or could it just be that he is bored and wants someone to hang out with?
1645;2;Does anyone know if we can use the KIP (Smart Indonesia Card) at Binus? And if so, which department handles it?
1646;0;Guys, I am currently working on my thesis and I need participants aged 11 to 18 years old, or junior and senior high school students living in Jakarta. If you have a sibling or know someone who fits the criteria, would you kindly share the questionnaire link? Thank you! I will put the link in the comments.
1647;2;I have been exercising to improve my health and physique, but I still do not feel confident when talking to others. I still prefer listening. It is sad being an introvert.
1648;0;Happy birthday to your mother.
1649;0;Someone from Visual Communication Design Animation class of 2020 with the initials SS is really attractive.
1650;2;Trust me, if you are working on something and do it without any distractions, you will finish it that same day. Even if it takes longer, the results will exceed your expectations. However, the distractions from your own mind are hard to avoid. Like when you are in the middle of working on something and suddenly start thinking, 'Who will be my future partner?' and 'Who will I end up marrying?' That is just how it is.
1651;2;It is so exhausting to have a work partner who does not make any effort and only asks for clients. They say if there is a client, just give it to them, and I will get the bonus. That is so convenient for them. It is not even about the bonus — I am tired too from looking for clients. Sometimes people can be so foolish.
1652;0;Can anyone recommend a boarding house around Binus Kemanggisan with a maximum price of 4 million rupiah per month? I am looking for one with a water heater, smart TV, window, queen-sized bed, private bathroom, air conditioner, and Wi-Fi.
1653;1;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipJ6-kLGGZw If my history teacher explained it like this, I would have chosen Social Studies earlier.
1654;1;B22 Architecture, stay strong. Instead of being given leniency, online classes are made even harder than usual. The lecturers are really inhumane.
1655;2;"I don't make mistakes. I'm not """"just like the rest of you."""" I'm stronger. I'm smarter. I'm better. I am better. I'm not some weak-kneed f**king crybaby that goes around f**king apologizing all the time. And why the f**k would you want me to be? All my life, people have tried to control me. My whole life. Rich people, powerful people have tried to muzzle me, cancel me, keep me impotent and obedient, like I'm a f**king puppet. You know what? It worked. Because I allowed it to work. And guess what. If they can control me, then you can bet your a$$ they can control you. They already do. You just don't realize it. I'm done. I am done apologizing. I am done being persecuted for my strength. You people should be thanking Christ that I am who and what I am, because you need me!!! You need me to save you! You do. I am the only one who possibly can. You're not the real heroes. I'm the real hero. - Homelander"
1656;2;How many months is the semester break from the even to the odd semester? After that, what kind of activities are usually held? Something like welcoming?
1657;1;After the midterms, I will start attending on-site classes. Can you tell me what the downsides of on-site classes are?
1658;2;I am so exhausted. My father is extremely stingy. After having an affair, my family feels like a cruel stepfamily.
1659;2;My ex has been messaging me again lately. He is the type of person who treats money lightly. In his mind, everything can be bought with money—even dignity. He once got involved with my friend, and I was shocked. The girl admitted it, but he did not. However, he always protected me so I would not be harmed, either by him or by others. I was even willing to accept his flaws. Hey, I love you not because of money, but sincerely from my heart. I am giving you a second chance to change, okay?
1660;1;My friend drew me a flower and sang me a song to make me feel better. So, if you cannot treat me better than my friend, please leave.
1661;1;Is it polite to ask the boarding house manager to help clean the room? It is unsettling because the room has been left unattended for more than half a year.
1662;1;Commuting costs sixty thousand per day. Is it better to just rent a boarding room if it is fully on-site?
1663;1;If a girl suddenly cancels a plan to meet, what could be the reason?
1664;1;To the person who ghosted me for someone else, I hope that person ends up ghosting you too. (That is very vengeful)
1665;2;I hope next semester will be fifty-fifty, both online and offline. I really want to go to campus.
1666;1;Has anyone ever been to Beehub? Do you just enter like usual?
1667;2;Getting dumped really hurts, does it not?
1668;2;"I was born in 2001, and I can connect well with a friend who was born in 1996. But with those born in 2005 or 2006, I feel completely disconnected. It feels like the age gap is too big. I cannot understand what they talk about; their way of communicating and socializing just feels different. I relate more to the older generation. Perhaps this is because of the influence of technological development?"
1669;1;What is the application deadline for internships in computer science?
1670;1;I just realized something from the HIMTI response videos. If the lecturer is good, there are only a few views. [...] and then look at the views on the response.
1671;1;Classes start again tomorrow. I can no longer stay up late.
1672;2;If a girl no longer initiates the conversation, does that mean she is already bored?
1673;0;Hello, initials PMH IA RJ CJ SM DDU
1674;2;I really want the quarantine to end quickly, but people are being stupid going out and about, infections keep increasing, and quarantine just gets longer. Idiots. I have been depressed staying in this room the whole time.

1680;1;Can someone give a review of the streaming/minor for the Information Systems major?
1681;2;What is wrong with this Indonesian language lecturer? If you want to teach, please do not act like that—it makes the students uncomfortable. Male students are given topics that are relevant to the real world, but for female students it is always about love. Do you think all that women have on their minds is love? Then you punish students by making them sing. In a 1.5-hour class, you only taught for five minutes using a presentation. Is this what you call learning?
1682;2;"I thought I was the only one who felt strange, but it turns out this work environment is truly toxic. Even the office driver told me, ""Madam has been here a long time, while the others come and go so often that I cannot even remember their names."" And I have only been here for two months. I do not have any friends here, and I was even bullied. But since I have become the kind of person who is thick-skinned and ignores things, I just let it go. The driver said that no one stays here for long because the environment is really unhealthy. Not only that, the bosses are also often disrespectful. The salary is just enough, yet they expect staff who can do everything from A to Z. Thank God my salary here is neither big nor small—it is just right. Hopefully I can survive here for at least a year, because finding a job is not easy."

1705;0;I hope all of our midterm exam scores turn out great.
1706;2;I am currently in a position where I do not know whether I am depressed or just overly sad. I want to go to a psychologist or psychiatrist, but I am afraid that I might not actually have any issue, and in the end, it would just be a waste of money since it is expensive.
1707;1;Who here is afraid of becoming an adult?

1724;2;I tested positive after the antigen test. But I am supposed to be onsite on the 2nd. If I am still not negative by then, can I still fill out the DHD form to attend online first?
1725;1;I am fascinated by her, but we are placed at different internship locations. So now I am confused about what to do.
1726;2;I feel like ending my life.
1727;1;I feel like I just started college in 2018, and now it is already 2022. Life really goes by that fast, guys.
1728;1;Do you believe in the apocalypse?
1729;0;Does anyone know how to book a discussion room at Beehub?
1730;2;I had been in a relationship with my partner for five years. But in the past few months, they got to know a girl from Tinder who happens to be in the same major. I got replaced. I guess I will just wish the best for both of you.
1731;0;SO HERE IS THE THING, EVERYONE. I WANT TO VENT, OKAY? SO BASICALLY I---- AND THAT IS THE STORY. THAT IS ALL.
1732;0;For Computer Science students who have not gotten an internship yet... Kawan Lama is still looking for 3 System Support Programmers and 1 Mobile Programmer. You can apply directly on the website: https://karir.kawanlamagroup.com/ Also, drop your Discord usernames so I can inform the HR department directly.
1733;0;Is your father a meatball seller? How did you know? Because you have stirred my feelings.
1734;0;My schedule has started to change to onsite. Rest in peace.
1735;1;I invited them to do a group project, but when I was a little late, they immediately went home. But when they were late for an hour, I waited while working on their part of the assignment.
1736;2;Is it better to wait for the exam guide from the lecturer or to summarize the material directly... I feel really stupid after two years of everything being online. (Sudden fate of onsite Exam)
1737;1;After getting involved in the world of vaccine volunteering, I was suddenly recruited by the coordinator into his wedding organizer business. So I ended up helping organize weddings, and it turns out managing everything up to the wedding day is not that easy, my friend. But it also made me want to get married soon because everything looked so adorable.
1738;1;Guys, for OJ SOCS, what is the minimum number of problems we need to solve to get a passing final score so we do not have to retake the course?
1739;1;Can the demo return my feelings instead?
1740;0;Bruno Mars is playing football again and then builds the Scarlet Phantom item to increase his attack speed.
1741;1;So my lab lecturer expects at least 50% of Kemanggisan students to attend onsite. But he does not even teach, instead he asks the students to present each chapter. This lecturer is such a joke.
1742;1;Has anyone ever had counseling at SASC? Is it online or offline? And is it recommended?
1743;2;Next semester's onsite classes are divided again into shift A and shift B. Binus really does not consider the students who live in boarding houses, especially those who live far away. Even the government already allows 100% onsite.
1744;1;I wonder if I can graduate with honors.
1745;1;By the way, are there no more games on Facebook now? I miss playing Car Town, Wild Ones, and Ninja Saga.
1746;2;Guys, what should I do. A male friend asked me to hang out. But I already have a boyfriend, although he is studying abroad. We have been in a long-distance relationship since high school, when we still lived in the same town. I told him about this male friend who invited me to go out, just the two of us. My boyfriend said, “Sure, it is okay, just go.” I was surprised and asked again, “Are you really okay with this?” He said, “Yes, just go have fun, broaden your horizons while you are in Jakarta.” He said I was too much of a homebody and should not stay at home all the time or I would not know the outside world. That is true — I am a homebody. So now I am confused. Is there anything wrong with this situation? We often call and check in with each other, so I am confident he would not fall for another girl there. But this situation made me overthink. Is he really giving me freedom out of love, or is he no longer interested in me and that is why he is not being protective anymore? What I know is that usually, a guy would be protective.
1747;1;Please, as a guy, do not be unclear. It is very uncomfortable.
1748;1;I should just back off. You are looking for someone attractive, but remember, being attractive does not always mean having a kind heart.
1749;0;Is there anyone here who applied for Kampus Merdeka?
1750;2;Are the students here not FED UP??? With the cowardly system at BINA NUSANTARA? Or is it the students themselves who are cowards?
1751;1;A person indeed cannot ask someone else to accompany them 24 hours a day out of loneliness, but they do not want that someone — who they already see as home — to leave. It does not have to be 24/7 companionship, but they know there is a home where they can rest and be their true self. Maybe they communicate often, but not always...
1752;1;Don’t cry when the sun is gone, because the tears won’t let you see the stars.
1753;1;Oh Lord, my friend’s girlfriend is really beautiful and calming to look at. I am not going to steal her or anything, I just enjoy seeing your girl.
1754;1;Where did Hayase go? Why does he rarely show up anymore?
1755;1;I have feelings for two people. One is my boyfriend, and the other is a guy from work. Yes, go ahead and judge me. But you have never experienced this.
1756;1;Guys, has Twitter SC not been responding since yesterday?
1757;1;For the internship as a site supervisor in Enrichment Apps, they have not asked us to fill anything out yet, right?
1759;2;For the non-class thesis, can we do the supervision sessions together like a group? As long as we complete ten meetings with the lecturer? And is it possible to change our supervisor once they have been assigned?
1760;2;Hey, is the knowledge gap for the NLP and ML courses really big? The lecturer thinks we are already good at Python, but we are still struggling. From the beginning, we never even touched Python and now we are suddenly expected to code all kinds of things.
1761;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qpij62t1zs Listen to something calming first so you will not feel too tense.
1762;1;I want to work on the midterm, but I am really sleepy, seriously.
1763;0;Good luck with your exams, everyone!
1764;1;Two days until the deadline and the paper is still blank. God, help me!
1765;1;Believe me, college is much more enjoyable than working. Regards, B17.
1766;0;For the seniors from the School of Information Systems, could you please share last year’s UAP or TM questions for study purposes? Thank you.
1767;2;So I just took the test where people say things like “your future depends on your grades.” Anyway, it turns out there were no theories in the final exam for CIT. My classmates were worried for nothing, since the task was only to draw. You should have seen their faces.
1768;0;Who got destroyed by Data Structures and OOP? Raise your hand.
1769;2;One of the final exams is onsite. Well then, here we go, #B24. From semester 1 to 5, I only experienced one onsite exam. How about you, B25 and B26? Are your final exams fully onsite?
1770;2;So many girls are using codenames for their crushes.
1771;0;Earlier, I held hands with Bae Suzy, but it was in a dream.
1773;1;Why can my partner, who is a student at Undip and lives nearby, not even make time for me?
1774;1;If you really are here...
1775;2;Wait… My lecturer said the final exam is going to be onsite. Which one is correct — onsite or online? The problem is, the midterm was said to be onsite too, but it ended up being online.
1776;1;They post so many stories on their first account like an influencer, but when it comes to the group chat, they do not show up at all.
1777;1;There should probably be an age limit for being a hopeless romantic. At this age, it should not feel normal to still be like that.
1778;1;Which laptop has good RGB color accuracy, like 100%, other than a Mac? I am looking for one with slightly better specifications.
1779;2;This is what happens when you date in secret for four months, and then last week you finally introduce each other to your parents, only to find out that his mother is actually your father’s younger sister. I never knew because I never joined big family gatherings. I have no choice but to break up.
1780;0;Who knows, maybe someone needs my QR code.
1781;1;Just got to know someone from social media, then I checked their LinkedIn and added them to my close friends. But when I ghosted them, they never appeared in my close friends again.
1782;1;Sunibiaaan, I want to ask. If a girl and a boy are close friends, who usually catches feelings first, the girl or the boy?
1783;0;Will the student center be crowded during the mid-term exams?
1784;1;For those who have gone through onsite exams, how was it? What were the ups and downs?
1785;1;Please do not talk about things you have little to no knowledge on. Not everything you see on the internet is true. Not everything people told you is true. There are things you need to learn by yourself. Trace back every information, statement, and claim, back to their very original source. If the source doesn't connect to the problems, or if it turns out to be a loose end, then the information is most likely not a valid one in the first place. Learn the context, and you will see how much words are twisted to suit the speaker's needs.
1786;1;I was a bit surprised because the question format was different from usual. Or maybe it was just my course.
1787;2;Those who already made promises will lose to those who are the priority.
1788;2;Do you agree that a man cheats because he feels insecure about his partner, whom he sees as 'better' than him (in terms of salary)? Is that justifiable? So women are not allowed to work? If anyone supports this idea, I would really laugh. Does that mean women should always be below men?
1789;1;The way they teach is unclear, and the exam questions are extremely difficult. Seriously.
1790;2;Have you ever had a toxic friend but felt unsure whether to cut them off or not? Because not having friends can also be hard, especially when something happens and there is no one to help you.
1791;2;This happened a long time ago, but I suddenly remembered it. I was on the commuter train and to make it easier, let’s label the seats A, B, C, D, E. I was sitting in seat A. There was a group of five people—four sat in B, C, D, and E, while one person remained standing. When we arrived at a station, a mother with a child got on and stood in front of me. I immediately stood up and offered my seat to her. But then the group quickly moved— the person in B shifted to A, C to B, and so on. So the one who had been standing now got a seat. I said, “Miss, please provide a seat for this mother.” But the girls from that group ignored me, pretending not to hear by using earphones. The mother said, “It is alright, thank you for offering.” I let it go, but it still bothers me how selfish they were.
1792;2;How do you get conservatory hours? I swear I still have absolutely no idea until now.
1793;1;When are the final exams and how many days off will we have?
1794;1;My brain is fried. Bzzzz.
1795;1;Come on, let us keep the spirit up!
1796;2;Well, my boyfriend who has been with me for six years has become friends with toxic people who do not care that he is actually in a relationship with me. The girls act overly friendly with him, and the guys often talk in a way that insults others. What should I do? I know that if he keeps hanging out with them, things will eventually go badly, and we will not be compatible anymore. I have talked to him about it many times, but he keeps pushing through. Should I just let him go?
1797;2;So, I have a boyfriend who is into the gym. Then he got offered to be a coach for his friends (all of them are girls). Honestly, I feel a bit jealous. What should I do?
1798;2;I am tired of being in a friend group with an odd number of people. When there are group assignments, there will always be a group of two people, and I will be the one left out. It is better for me to just leave the group.
1799;1;Remember, ADA stands for Algorithm Design and Analysis, not Algorithm Copy and Paste. – My ADA lecturer.
1800;0;Is everyone confident about the Artificial Intelligence final exam?
1801;1;Guys, where can I access the internship application in BIMAY?
1802;0;Hello, this is David speaking.
1803;1;Tomorrow I have to pay a tuition bill of 8.2 million rupiah. Wow, that is really something.
1804;1;Just ban arsene_lupin again.
1805;1;What is the correct step-by-step skincare routine?
1806;1;I am very confused. Entrepreneurship class is so unclear.
1807;1;If you want to comment, at least make it like Hayase. Do not just leave random comments just to get points. It is exactly like an empty barrel making the loudest noise.
1808;0;Good luck with your final exams, my friends. I hope our grades will be safe and satisfactory.
1809;2;I am very stressed out. Midterms, preparing a project, and getting ready for a competition. University is really tough.
1810;1;This loneliness has made me realize many things.
1811;2;Man, if Special Program is online, there is no midterm exam. The grading weights are 20% for assignments, 30% for midterms, and 50% for final exams. But when the grades came out, the midterm was 0. How should I calculate the remaining 30% then?
1812;2;I cannot believe it. It is February, and I am about to do my thesis defense and graduate soon, but I still do not have a partner to accompany me for both the defense and graduation. Help me, please.
1813;2;I was so shocked to see a variable tuition fee bill of 21,560,000 rupiah. That is 21.5 million.
1814;2;I am mentally exhausted. I am really pathetic.
1815;2;In the past, submitting the midterm late made me cry. Now, I laugh when I submit late—laughing at myself for repeating the same mistake.
1816;1;Not a blue check mark does not mean the message was not read.
1817;0;Everyone replied too slowly yesterday so I ended up falling asleep. I am so bored, guys, let us chat!!
1818;2;I am tired of college. I want to get married. Ah ah ah hahahahahahaha
1819;1;What should I do if I feel jealous?
1821;2;No matter how many times you try to explain, it will not be understood if your voice keeps echoing. We already said we could not hear, but you kept explaining in a place where the microphone could not pick up your voice. My classmates reminded you three times already. Please, Sunib, upgrade the microphones so both students and lecturers can have a better learning experience.
1822;0;I identify as a Transformer. URH URH ARH ERH ERH.
1823;1;Are there still many people who have not found an internship yet? I keep overthinking, I keep getting ghosted all the time.
1824;2;A stupid person like me cannot do anything, damn it. I might as well just be trash.
1825;1;Keep up the spirit, guys. Only three more days to go. We can do this!
1826;1;Hi guys, I am currently doing research. Could you help me out? There is this baking supplies brand from Singapore that wants to enter the Indonesian market. If I were to analyze the Indonesian market for both B2B and B2C, what aspects could I include? I am running out of ideas. Thank you!!
1827;0;Are you asking me?
1828;1;If you consider yourself her friend, please leave a comment. I want to ask what kind of guy she likes.
1829;0;This is for the freshmen. You can get the highest SAT score during FEP. That is why you should not skip it. There will also be seminars in your own semester later, so technically you do not need to attend this semester’s. In the past, there were also study abroad programs, and you could get quite a lot of SAT points from those too. You go abroad and earn SAT points—what more could you ask for? Just take this as a little tip from a senior. God bless us all!
1830;2;Binus is stingy! Please pay attention to students who are struggling financially. I feel sorry for them!
1831;2;Binus, please, we really need a break. Stop giving us assignments all the time. This is supposed to be a holiday, not a homework marathon.
1832;1;You are beautiful and delightful, but I was only ever a friend who tasted you once, unlike your boyfriend.
1833;2;Do not stop coding? Damn it, do you really think I will follow that in a situation like this with everything online?
1834;0;Just a little promo: if anyone is looking for dessert recommendations to accompany your work or studies, feel free to check out @munchoco.id. Thank you!
1835;2;Keep on paying and paying, I am going bankrupt just from covering Sunib fees.
1836;1;Is Binusmaya having an error? Mine cannot seem to open.
1837;1;"My boyfriend often does not reply to my messages for more than 24 hours. Every time I ask why, he always says, ""I forgot that there was a message."" That means I am being forgotten too, right? Should I just break up or continue this? It has been like this for three months. I am confused. The fate of having a relationship online."
1838;2;https://sunibcurhat.com/post/Geg0m6/kenapa-ya-tiap-kali Please, I once walked around campus at 6:30 in the morning and the toilets were still locked, so I ended up walking around two floors and could not find one.
1839;1;On the first day of internship, is everyone bringing their laptops?
1840;0;GSLC (I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE FOR A LONG TIME)
1841;0;DARE: Write the initials of your crush along with their major.
1842;2;Tired tired tired
1843;1;My motivation to work hard is so that Baim Wong does not come to visit me.
1844;0;"Cianjur has turned into ""Cianjir"" instead."
1845;1;How do I go from Jakarta to Binus Alam Sutera using public transportation? Please help with a tutorial.
1846;2;"I have been asking to be taught how to drive for a long time but I am never allowed, there is always some excuse. Today I brought it up again and was told, ""You should think more rationally."" What? Why is that irrational? Are you afraid I will go wandering around and not come home? That is impossible, with this coronavirus situation I will not go anywhere."
1847;2;I am doomed, the exam is entirely in English.
1848;2;I am really sad because on June 21 I have fieldwork.
1849;0;Who here is doing an internship in the government? Can you share how you applied?
1850;1;"Isaiah 60:22 ""When the time is right, I, The Lord, will make it happen."" Be patient."
1851;2;"Have you ever met a stranger who asked, ""Are you from Jakarta?"" ""Are you from Bekasi?"" or ""Are you from xxxx?"" Then they continue, ""Can I ask you a few questions? I am not a bad person, really."" What are they trying to do? I have experienced this twice, near BNI City and Bekasi Station."
1852;2;Hey, I think I saw someone yesterday who got an internship at Gojek Tokopedia. Please show yourself, I want to ask some questions.
1853;1;Until my final semester, my love story has still not arrived.
1854;1;Hey, why does the essay section of the database feel a bit empty and odd?
1855;1;https://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/a/perbuatan-yang-termasuk-dalam-pasal-pencemaran-nama-baik-lt517f3d9f2544a Everyone, read this. It is for those of you who slandered my friend even though they were not proven guilty as you claimed on Suncur.
1856;1;Has there already been an announcement about onsite classes? My lecturer said in yesterday's meeting that it is still uncertain because the class has been hybrid all this time, but they did say that some classes will probably be onsite.
1857;1;Do you have any tips on how to start a relationship with my crush who is in the same class?
1858;1;I hope every day in your life feels like a Monday.
1859;1;How can someone survive in Jakarta with two million rupiah?
1860;0;Is there anyone here who is skilled in Indonesian Sign Language? I want to learn it.
1861;2;Is there anyone who wants to go to Catholic church together? I feel really sad going alone all the time.
1862;2;All of my midterm exams are finally over. Oh my God, I cannot believe it.
1863;1;So I misread the project deadline date, and I ended up doing it on the exact day it was due, just one hour before the deadline. Rest in peace, my lab project grade.
1864;1;Is it weird or normal if someone who is not from the same batch randomly tries to befriend me on Instagram just to ask about college stuff? I replied to the message but did not follow them back because I only follow people I know closely. Would they think I am arrogant?
1865;2;What if I already registered for the independent study program and then I get accepted for an internship? I am really confused.
1866;1;My friends always take a long time to reply to messages. I want to take revenge, but my hands feel itchy to reply quickly, and I also feel bad ignoring them in case it is something important.
1867;1;Serious question: is it true that men are afraid to be in a relationship with an independent woman?
1868;0;Test how close you are with your partner! For example, I video called mine while he was using the toilet.
1869;2;Hi all, may I ask something? Has anyone ever borrowed a room in Beehub? I need a room for a CB project, but LSC will not lend a classroom, and the lecturer is making things more difficult. Do you have any other recommendations?
1870;1;I once posted an NGL link in my Instagram story, but only a few people sent messages even though more than 150 people viewed it. Sigh, do I really not have any friends?
1871;1;Happy New Year 2023. I hope whatever you wish for in this year will soon come true. What are your hopes? Personally, my hope is for the SAT to be fully available and for community service to be easily accessible.
1872;1;I am sorry for being selfish. I do not want you to get close to other women even if they are just friends. Honestly, I do not want to feel this way either, but it always comes from love and fear of losing you.
1873;1;I am in my tired-of-life era.
1874;2;PART 4: FAN CHU KEW (PIG DOG DEMON)
1875;2;Help, the first midterm exam is coming up soon, and I am extremely stressed just thinking about it. I still do not fully understand the material, my SOCS answers were marked wrong by the online judge, and now we have to do things onsite too. Zjwuwggew8t33g
1876;1;How do you forget embarrassing or awkward moments that keep haunting your mind whenever you are trying to sleep?
1877;1;I need a kiss now, please.
1878;1;Hi, IBM student. How have you been? Everything is going well with your new partner, right?
1879;2;Is the class schedule really finalized? Why is everything via video conference? It is quite sad being someone from out of town who came here just for video calls... I even already rented a place to live.
1880;1;Is independent study only for one semester? If so, can we do an internship in the following semester? Or take another independent study?
1881;1;Dksrs, how are you?
1882;0;Can you share your experience if you have ever taken a final exam on-site?
1883;1;So this is how it feels to take an on-site exam, huh?
1884;2;I am confused by the song lyrics 'I have no flowers, I have no wealth, all I have is a loyal and sincere heart for you.' If all you have is a sincere heart, that is really sad. Does that mean you will not get married? Because getting married also needs money.
1885;2;To those who are currently doing internships, I want to ask, do you still work during collective leave or do you get days off? Because I heard some companies still make you work.
1886;1;Everyone, how do we contact the EPC of our department?
1887;1;For psychology majors, what kind of enrichment is recommended? I have already taken an internship for next semester, but I also want to try something different in semester 7. I want to take the fast track, but after the recent info session, I am afraid I might not be able to catch up because I am not confident in doing well in business management. I also want to study abroad, but when I tried applying, the options were very limited. On top of that, I want to take the IELTS, but it is expensive, and I keep thinking, what if I do not pass, then what is the point?
1888;1;Does Binus have holidays? That is a myth.
1889;2;I hate my face so much that I do not want to look in the mirror for long, I do not want to be photographed, I do not feel confident if I am not wearing a mask, I never want to post a photo of myself, and I always compare myself to others. Every time I open the camera or look in the mirror, I always think, 'I look so ugly.'
1890;2;What is wrong with my Beelingua? It keeps saying network error, even though everything else opens fine and does not lag.
1891;2;Does anyone have information on affordable final exam proxies? I have already given up.
1892;2;"My boarding house neighbor is truly awful, it turns out they have been keeping many snakes in their room. Now I cannot sleep peacefully. What if one of them escapes and enters my room?"""
1893;1;I have lost the motivation to study. There is already a war going on like this.
1895;2;In my opinion, it is a bit wasteful to go to campus for only one course in a day. At least make it two or three courses if it is going to be fully on-site. That way, we can save on transportation costs and not waste too much time. If there is an empty day, we can do other activities.
1896;2;I failed No Nut November because of the news about the police wanting to arrest the woman in the red kebaya.
1897;1;I want to ask, if a friend actually copies and pastes someone else’s assignment answer, what is the punishment? Does the person who gave the answer also get penalized?
1898;2;So, if we want to get good grades, do our answers really need to be super long? I personally like to go straight to the point. But every time I ask my friends, they say their answers are “short,” but even their “short” ones are over 200 words.
1899;2;Dear members of parliament, when passing the Criminal Code Bill, could you please use your brains a little? Why are you meddling in people’s private matters, reducing prison sentences for corrupt officials, criminalizing criticism of the government, banning protests, prohibiting the sale of condoms, and suppressing press freedom? You are even using it to justify treason charges. You are paid by the people, yet you are making the people’s lives harder. Please revoke this bill. If not, do not be surprised when the public and students take to the streets. It will not be our fault. Thank you for listening to our criticism as your constituents, and please remember to keep voicing #RejectCriminalCodeBill so that their ears, eyes, and hopefully their conscience—if they even have one—can be opened.
1900;1;I was interested in you. You seemed interested in me too. But it looks like the pandemic made you distant, did it not, R?
1901;0;If being apart from you is considered the best path, then I would rather take another one. Even if it is a bit broken, it is okay as long as I am with you.
1902;1;Every course should give us the freedom to choose whether we want to work in a group or individually. If we choose to work in a group, we can pick our members. But those who prefer to work alone should also be allowed to do so. Why must everything always be in groups? It should be our choice.
1903;1;My social skills have drastically declined since online college began. I used to speak fast and clearly, but now I speak slowly and stutter a lot.
1904;2;I miss attending college in person because the campus was my escape from my toxic parents who only know how to boss me around, compare me to others, and believe that everything I do is always wrong in their eyes.
1905;0;Girls, please use your skills and help me. Where can I find a decent man? Social media and dating apps seem to be full of untrustworthy people now. Is there any exclusive or privileged group that could help me find one?  Thank you in advance for your help. With love, Ms.
1906;0;Rewind 2022 was truly amazing.
1907;2;" It is almost February and I am still struggling to get an internship, while my current playlist consists of: ""I surrender (twice) to Jesus my Savior, I surrender~~"""
1908;2;I am exhausted working in this completely disorganized office. The company does not even have an organizational structure. Interns here are constantly stressed making reports because even the company itself lacks its own internal data. It is incredibly frustrating to have a supervisor who tells you to do task A, then complains after it is done, even though it was their own instruction. If it were not so difficult to find a new job, I would have resigned a long time ago.
1909;2;I feel like cursing out those foolish people who blindly accept everything labeled as “religious teachings” without thinking more broadly. One of the consequences of this lack of thought is the loss of innocent lives. Hurting yourself is already considered a sin, let alone harming or killing others in the name of jihad. You are disgraceful for tarnishing the name of religion and fueling interfaith conflicts. God forgive me, but I am extremely angry at people who refuse to think critically like this.
1910;1;Regret comes from the things we did not do when we had the chance.
1911;1;In your opinion, can someone who is Batak and someone who is Chinese actually end up together?
1912;1;Does anyone have experience hiring someone to take an exam for them? Please share the story.
1913;2;In the past, humans used to run away from wild animals. Nowadays, humans run from taxes, debt collectors, group project members, and deadlines.
1915;1;I still often watch my high school compete, to the point where people ask, “Why do you care so much about… (my school’s name)?” and what I say out loud is, “I just want it to be lively.” But what I really want to say is, “If it were not for… I would not have made it to where I am now, and I would not be the person you know today.”
1916;1;Do girls really prefer guys who are into sports?
1917;1;I got too comfortable with work that I ended up not focusing on my academic grades.
1918;0;I have officially become one of the top users on Suncur. It is time to retire, my friends.
1919;1;I thought I did not have any friends or social circle because of my bad attitude or because there was something wrong with me. But it turns out everyone was just wearing a mask.
1920;2;We just broke up and you are already looking for someone new. Yet just yesterday, before I ended things, you wrote me a long letter saying “I love you.” Unbelievable.
1921;0;The older male students at Sunib are quite handsome, are they not?
1922;0;Today at Binus Alam Sutera, I saw a lot of students wearing white shirts and orange nametags. What are they doing?
1923;1;Good evening, I would like to ask, for those who are doing the enrichment internship, has anyone already filled out the supervisor mapping? Do we fill it out ourselves or will there be an official notification telling us to do it? Thank you.
1924;0;For the “Latest Education” section, should we fill in our high school or university?
1925;1;I was messaged three times on WhatsApp and told to complete the Dreamtalent test. I ignored it because I thought it was a broadcast message. But it turns out the messages were real.
1926;1;For those who applied to CTI recently, has there been any update after the psychological test?
1927;1;The important thing is that the assignment is finished. Whether it is right or wrong can be dealt with later. At least there is nothing left hanging and it is not bothering my mind anymore.
1928;1;I have finally reached the end of my academic journey. But do we really have to continue ignoring each other like this? Is this really the end? Maybe I was the one who expected too much. But still, I always hope that someday we will meet again out there in the world, and continue what we left unfinished. It is still not too late.
1929;1;I want to ask, does the fixed tuition fee fall under credit-based payment or the BP3 category? The auto-debit is taking too long, and I want to register for courses. I am thinking of just paying manually.
1930;1;I just agreed with you so that you would be happy. That is the best way to help you move on. How can someone who is already engaged still be attached to another woman’s Instagram account?
1931;2;I also have experienced severe depression for a long time to the point that I began self-harming. I cut my arms, I made myself feel pain, I even punched the wall until the pain stopped meaning anything. I have attempted suicide, many times. All I wish for is to escape from this pain, because it really does hurt. I cannot even function properly at university. I cannot focus, I cannot study, I understand nothing. I also have another illness that cannot be cured. I have to pretend to be okay, because honestly, no one really cares.
1932;1;Is there anyone who still has not found an internship placement?
1933;1;It was the first day of full onsite classes, but I chose to attend online. The class was incredibly crowded, about 40 people. I skipped it. I only need to be onsite for a few of the required practical courses anyway.
1934;1;Why do men often have to give in during a relationship? I feel sad because I am the one who always has to give in every single day.
1935;1;Alright, I understand enough now.
1936;1;Before an onsite exam, we usually study beforehand, right? So if we are already in the classroom but there are still 30 minutes left before the exam starts, is it allowed to study in the class?
1937;0;It is fine to attend onsite classes, as long as I can mark the Daily Health Declaration as “sick” so I can still be considered online.
1938;1;I hope those who have not found an internship yet will be accepted soon! Stay strong, everyone.
1939;1;Guys, will there still be a Zoom link next year in case someone is sick?
1940;2;Honestly, I am not completely productive on weekends. The people at home make the atmosphere really unpleasant. But like it or not, I have to manage. Never give up!
1941;1;I want to go to counseling, does anyone know where I can find an affordable psychologist? Or does Binus provide any counseling services? I want to reach out but I am confused about who to talk to.
1942;2;My parents are forcing me to attend classes online instead of going to campus. There is nothing urgent, they just randomly want me to stay home so they have company. I actually want to go to campus because it has been a long break. Lately, my parents' requests have been really random, and their mood swings too—sometimes they get angry for no reason, sometimes they are really kind.
1943;0;Praise be to God, the exams are finally over.
1944;0;Where can I find a doctor or pharmacy around Kemanggisan?
1945;2;It is taking forever to get the SPTJM signed.
1946;1;Let us stay motivated for the enrichment.
1948;1;Because of so many GSLC assignments, I could not focus during the VC class.
1949;1;There is a guy approaching me, and I feel happy because I have someone to talk to. But he seems too good to be true, like he is too perfect in every way (at least for me). Then I get confused, because meeting a guy this high-quality makes me feel insecure.
1950;0;If anyone wants help with Japanese CM on Beelingua, feel free to message this Discord: Draco#6956.
1951;1;I care less and less about grades lately because I only have one course left. What matters is passing and not getting below a B.
1952;2;I am so annoyed with the nearsightedness comments on every top comment post on Instagram (those who know will understand).
1953;1;If I knew how to live against the system, maybe my life would not be this difficult.
1954;1;Can someone check whether the person claiming to be descended from a religious scholar is telling the truth or just trying to gain attention here?
1955;0;We have gone on three dates, and we keep wearing the same color clothes even though we did not plan it. What does it mean?
1956;1;Is the third vaccination currently required for internships at some companies?
1957;1;Has anyone still not gotten an internship?
1958;2;Kuncigoblok has been active since July 22, 2021 (almost two years on Suncur), and still has not been banned even though their comments are very disturbing. Please, admin, ban this person. Thank you.
1959;2;Why can I no longer watch xn** on my browser?
1960;1;Finally, today I received an interview call for an internship. Can anyone please give me tips for a phone interview? How many minutes does it usually take, what kinds of questions are asked, and what are your suggestions for answering them?
1961;1;What are your tips for dealing with a stubborn boyfriend?
1962;1;So I have a friend who is good at coding and wants to find a girlfriend, but it is difficult for him. That is why my friends and I tried to help him be more stylish and trendy. What should we do?
1963;1;I want to give encouragement to those whose assignments are piling up. Stay strong, everyone.
1964;1;Let us continue with online learning until graduation.
1965;2;If you were to pass away while chasing your dreams, would you be at peace with it?
1966;2;I am so jealous after finding out that my friends have holidays until February.
1967;1;Is Sunibgaming the same as Bacot Gaming from Binus Fess (Twitter)? If they are the same, then that must be the one with the initials 'DG', a Management student from class B26.
1968;1;I just opened Facebook and was immediately shown a tragedy of a person getting pulled into a grinding machine. Mark's habit of not censoring victims continues. May you have a good ending, sir.
1969;0;I have best friends who do not know each other.
1970;2;Listen, if you are not serious about studying, then just do not go to college. You people who are not serious only become burdens in group projects, do you realize that? We are the ones who work, yet you also get the grades. Wake up. Stop wasting your parents' money. You are causing trouble for many people.
1971;1;Girl: Where did you put my toothbrush? Boy: I threw it away. It was just making my room dirty.
1972;2;I am really tired of always being just an option for that guy.
1973;0;Captain on bridge
1975;1;I can only wait without being able to do anything.
1976;1;It is exhausting being a people pleaser. Friends only show up when they need something, then disappear without a word or lose contact.
1977;0;Is it worth it to become a laboratory assistant?
1978;1;Hey, if you want to become a faculty leader, do you have to be a member of the department organization?
1979;2;Never mind, I misread the question. Good luck to everyone on day four. All of you can do it!
1980;2;Sigh, I am fasting, chasing midterm deadlines, and also feeling heartbroken. It is really overwhelming.
1981;2;"First of all, I am a business major student. The professor asked us to create an ""imaginary"" business and plan it out. I joined a group, but I think our business idea is very bad and has no chance of ever being sold. It is too imaginary and unrealistic. How do I tell them without sounding arrogant and without hurting their feelings? Because the business idea is extremely bad."
1982;2;Tomorrow I have an internship test, but tonight is the deadline to register for an independent study class. I am confused. Which one do you think I should prioritize?
1983;1;Has anyone ever been a teaching assistant? Please share the good and bad sides of the experience.
1984;1;My silence does not mean that I am doing well. I am struggling right now, and the deadline is today at 1 PM. If there really was something called “support,” then they should have known I was struggling from the beginning. I apologize for not speaking up when I was having a hard time because ever since I started university, I never received a good response when I tried to express my difficulties. Since then, I have kept all the hardship to myself. It reached its peak when someone said they were ready to help if I was struggling, but when it came time to reach out to them, I just could not do it. Even if I had, it would not have ended well.
1985;2;It is really annoying to keep hearing “123… nyaaa… arigatou…” over and over.
1986;1;The account ban system is unfair. It said banned for 2 days, but after 2 days it still says banned for 2 days. It is really strange.
1987;2;"So earlier I asked the Binus admin about the onsite class schedule. I asked what would happen if I could not attend the onsite class, and the admin responded like this: ""We would like to inform you that if you are unable to attend the onsite class due to illness, please attach a medical certificate from a hospital. However, it is subject to policy."" So, does that mean attending online is still possible?"
1988;2;Is it really true that we should not expect too much from other people? Just because I think someone is kind does not mean I will get the same kindness in return. It already happened to me — I thought a friend of mine was kind, so I did not hesitate to ask for help. I expected them to be nice, but they did not even respond or help back. It was so frustrating. And it was not like I asked for the answers — I just asked for assignment information. So stingy.
1989;2;Is it normal for me to feel this way? Whenever I meet a guy and find out that his GPA is high, I immediately get attracted to him. Especially when I see that he is nerdy, I end up liking him. But none of my friends are like this, so I wonder why it is just me. Maybe it is because my father is nerdy and seems admirable, and I idolize men like that. One time I met a nerdy guy, and he immediately started talking to me about a topic he liked, but the topic was too heavy, so I lost interest. I was bored with the topic, but I was still impressed by him. But he noticed that I was uninterested, so he lost interest in me. I feel so conflicted — on one hand, I want to get close to nerdy guys, but on the other hand, I cannot keep up with them.
1990;0;Rewind 2022 was really great.
1991;2;During the midterm exams, I had a cough, a runny nose, and a fever. I thought it was because of the stress from the exams. This morning I went to the doctor and they asked me to take a swab test — and the result was positive (even though I already got 3 vaccine doses). Please take care of yourselves because COVID is still out there. Also, I did not go to the mall or hang out at all since the first day of the exams.
1992;1;Now classes are onsite, but only for one course — and it starts at 7 AM. Sigh.
1993;2;Is it okay if I just skip to the end of the year? I am so exhausted dealing with the drama of these life exams.
1994;1;Can eighth-semester students join activities from the TFI website? Please help me win the registration battle for TFI website activities, thank you.
1995;2;Never mind, I was just imagining things.

1997;2;I have also experienced depression to the point where I harmed myself. I tried to end my life. All I wish for is to escape from this pain. It hurts terribly. I cannot even function well at university—I can never focus. I also have other illnesses that are incurable. I am extremely afraid of being judged if I go to a psychologist or psychiatrist. Especially if a psychiatrist prescribes medication—I am scared of being judged as well.

1999;0;Hey Computer Science students, in semester two, are there any courses that are related to semester one?
2000;2;I most likely have symptoms of PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), and I have always had difficulties maintaining my mental health 1–2 weeks before menstruation. During that period, I often feel anxious for no reason, easily get angry, suddenly lose feelings, lose interest in hobbies, have no appetite, feel constantly tired and achy, and want to sleep all the time. I always feel like everything is my fault. All of this makes me want to end my life every month. Right now, I also feel like ending my life. I know this is not depression. I know I will return to my usual self in a few days, but it is very distressing. All I can think about now is how easy and quick it would be if I just died—every problem and worry would be over. I am tired of thinking like this for years. This morning I explained everything to my mother. She just hugged me and said, “It is just a silly thought, do not think about it, just think about something better.” I told her it would be better if I took medication prescribed by a doctor. My mother got angry. She said that brain medication is only for crazy people who want to hurt or kill others. She said I would go insane if I took that medication. Honestly, I already knew my parents would react this way. I do not even know what I was hoping for—maybe understanding and support? But I am trying to hold myself together because I just got into a relationship and my partner is supportive. Still, if I keep acting like this, I am afraid he will leave me. He already said he would not, but because of this PMDD, I can only think that he will leave me for someone better. I do not know what to do anymore. I cannot work, study, play games, read comics, or do anything without feeling exhausted and hopeless. I have already booked a counseling session. I hope it helps, but I do not know. I truly want to die, but I also know I will not feel this way once my period ends. I am confused and tired.
2001;0;What is your favorite life quote, everyone?
2002;1;When will we be able to take a vacation without thinking about anything?
2003;0;I hope the flooding in your house recedes soon.
2004;1;Dear God, please give me the strength to be in the same group as my crush in the entrepreneurship class for the next three semesters.
2005;1;B26, do you also feel that SOCS Lab 9 is extremely difficult and there is no cure for it?
2006;1;Sunib does not play social circle games, right? It is really hard to make friends online. Sorry, just a first-year student complaining again.
2007;0;It might be stressful for you, but not for me. I will not let it become that way, and we will have different outcomes.
2008;1;Since the fourth semester, whenever there is a long break between classes, I always go alone to Alam Sutera Mall and stop by Funworld to play the Hero of Robots game. From the time the machine was still there until it was no longer available—I do not even know why—I managed to get three black cards (a black card is a card that must be exchanged at the counter for a mystery card). There was a time I should have received only one card, but two came out at once. Recently, I have only been playing Wangan Midnight version 3DX+, and I was surprised that it could still read my card and that the ink was still visible. While watching others hang out with their friends, chat happily, and spend time together, I realized I only experienced that once, and it never happened again. Being by myself allows me to think freely and peacefully. Unfortunately, if anyone wanted to accompany me, it is already too late because semester six is entering enrichment in just a few days. I probably will not be able to go to Alam Sutera Mall again.
2009;2;Fifth semester assignments are just too overwhelming. Oh my goodness.
2010;0;Has anyone ever submitted an independent community service proposal? What activity did you propose? How many hours did you get?
2011;0;This might be an interesting question... What is the closest time you have ever submitted an exam before the deadline? Mine was due at 17:00, and I submitted it at 16:59:57.
2012;1;Being someone who overthinks really does not feel good.
2013;1;If a girl ignores us, does that mean she does not care about us?
2014;1;I do not own a motorcycle or a car, and I always feel like I am not worthy of having a partner.
2015;1;It is crazy. I do not even know how many times I have been approached by guys, and not long after, they post a story with their girlfriends.
2016;0;"Who here has the courses ""Statistical Methods"" and ""Numerical Analysis"" next semester, and what is your major?"
2017;0;Guys, how do you approach a girl?
2018;0;If we are already accepted by a company but not through the enrichment app, is that allowed?
2019;1;Going back and forth between Tangerang and Bekasi is extremely exhausting. On top of that, it rained all day, so the traffic got even worse.
2020;0;Guys, where do you usually find community service opportunities?
2021;1;I want to ask, is there a place to practice coding other than SOCS, where the answers are also available? Because sites like HackerRank do not provide the answers, right?
2022;0;Baby, you are worth the wait. If you could see me just once, you would know how deeply I would fall for you, for you.
2023;1;It is already the Christmas holiday but there are still deadlines. I really do not understand anymore.
2024;1;To be honest, please do not be salty. From my personal point of view, I do not want to attend offline classes, not because of COVID, but for personal reasons. First, I am already comfortable studying online while making money. Second, I do not have many friends, you could say I do not have a circle, and most of my friends do (although this second point does not bother me too much). Third, I really do not like having to dress up nicely, especially if there is only one class in a day—it just feels like a waste of effort. Fourth, I am a bit insecure (although if you saw my appearance, you probably would not believe I am broke). Fifth, I simply do not want to attend offline classes.
2025;1;Seriously, all of you...
2026;2;Brother, do you want to focus on studying or on student organizations? If you want to focus on organizations, you might as well quit university and join a political party. Please do not be a burden.
2027;1;Is Bimay having an error right now? I am trying to upload a photo but it is not working.
2028;1;If you get angry over a soccer game you did not play in, you probably have serious anger management issues.
2029;1;It must be nice to be pretty.
2030;2;I do not know anyone at my new boarding house. I want to get to know the new neighbors, but I am afraid they might feel uncomfortable.
2031;1;Please, Sunib, give us the exact graduation date. It is not that I am trying to be difficult, but if the graduation ends up being on a weekday, it feels uncomfortable having to ask my boss for sudden leave. It is already close to December, please, I am begging.
2032;0;When will there be an Instagram account for 'handsomesunib' and 'prettysunib'?
2033;1;Guys, does anyone know of any good boarding houses near Binus Kemanggisan? Preferably ones that are not too far if you are walking.
2034;0;Guys, what is the Human-Computer Interaction course like in Computer Science? Can you give a rough idea?
2035;0;My father issues make me feel really happy when friends give me physical affection or when I feel protected. Is this wrong? I get emotional very easily—it just feels nice.
2036;0;Where and at what time is the final exam for BL 22 tomorrow?
2037;2;This is crazy, Binus. I already submitted a request to move the FE course from last even semester, and it was approved since August, but it still has not been moved? I already asked SSC and they said it is guaranteed to be moved, but now it is already the second week of the semester and nothing has changed. It would be a different story if I submitted the request in September when the schedule was already finalized and processing might take longer.
2038;0;If I major in Computer Science but choose a specialization in UI/UX later on, is that reasonable?
2039;2;PLEASE, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE TO PRINT AT THE ALSUT PRINTER, MAKE SURE YOUR FILE IS ALREADY A PDF AND READY TO PRINT. DO NOT EDIT IT ON THE COMPUTER THERE. MANY PEOPLE ARE QUEUING TO PRINT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

2043;0;Please recommend a lightweight laptop that is easy to carry around and durable enough for writing a thesis.
2044;1;Is there anyone whose internship has very little work?
2045;2;Alright. The event is over, and now my Line is really quiet... even a message from five days ago is still at the top. Back then, while I was handling the event, so many chats came in. I was confused about how to shift the conversation from work stuff to more general topics. Honestly, I am really bad at chatting. Talking directly is still okay.
2046;1;Someone: You will feel better soon, but someday Me: Yes, maybe in the afterlife
2047;2;Damn, it really hurt when I heard him talking about his ex, even though just yesterday he went out with me and acted like he had feelings for me.
2048;1;What would you do if you had a problem with your ex, but you still wanted to be close friends?
2049;2;It really is different with rich kids... You want to be jealous or annoyed because their life seems perfect, but they are just so nice.
2050;2;[Trigger warning. Not sure what, perhaps self-harm?] Today I was supposed to take my sick cat to the clinic. I made the appointment myself, and the plan was to go with my dad and my sister. But due to my own stupid mistake, I accidentally booked it for the wrong date (I meant to book it for today, but it got booked for yesterday instead). Everything became a bit messy. It was complicated, but I still communicated with the customer service. Turns out they still had a slot tonight, so I hurried to make a new appointment. At that point I was already very upset and anxious (for some reason I am very afraid of going to places with people I cannot rely on. My dad is shy just like me, while my sister is used to handling things like this). Then it turned out the information from customer service did not match the website. In short, it was a mess. My dad even asked why it became so complicated, and my mom got angry and said I should pay more attention and not rush. I was so angry and upset with myself because my carelessness made everything complicated. I know this sounds dramatic, but I cried very hard in secret, hit my head, and so on, because I was so stupid and made something that should have been simple become such a hassle. On top of that, I felt confused and tired because of the anxiety. I am really scared of going to new places with people I do not fully trust to accompany or support me. Also, tomorrow there is an event where I have to meet many people, and I am SUPER DUPER scared. So in conclusion, today I experienced a lot of fear and anxiety. Thank you.
2051;0;So, what are the requirements to become a teaching assistant?
2052;1;I told my crush that I am getting close to another guy. How does a jealous guy usually respond? I want to know whether he is jealous or not.
2053;0;So I liked a girl who is a cosplayer, I moved too slowly, and then someone else got her.
2054;2;Is there anyone whose neck muscles feel extremely tense because of the final exam...?
2055;1;In this kind of situation, the only thing I can do is to vent to fellow Binus students, because we can understand each other. Stay strong everyone, we are all fighting together, you are not alone. I send a hug to each of you.
2056;1;I sincerely wish that people who make others suffer on the road will have an increasingly difficult life.
2057;1;Happy birthday....
2058;2;Damn, only one person came onsite.
2059;0;When will the final grades be released?
2060;1;I have a younger brother who is in his first semester at Binus. Before the midterms, he got hybrid classes. Since he had onsite classes, he rented a room near campus and stayed with me (in a separate room). After the midterms, all his classes became fully online until the second semester, so he went back home. Suddenly, I started feeling lonely because he was leaving to go back. This is the first time I have felt like this.
2061;0;What can we learn from COVID and its connection to business? Keep innovating quickly and understand your target market.
2062;0;Guys, which first semester course is related to scientific computing?
2063;0;Is B24 available, or is it just BOT?
2064;1;I look completely fine, I can still laugh and smile, but when I am alone in my room, I feel like screaming out loud just to let go of all the weight in my heart.
2065;1;Rest in peace, Shinzo Abe.
2066;1;New Year’s Eve was full of drama. Suddenly, while we were playing with firecrackers, some older men and women started yelling at the kids. They even brought up religion, shouting, “ARE YOU CHRISTIANS? WHY ARE YOU PLAYING WITH THAT RELIGIOUS SYMBOL?” As a Christian myself, I honestly wanted to laugh.
2067;2;I really want to curse and say, “Web programming is truly a damn, stupid, hellish, trash subject,” but I am still holding myself back because I am afraid of sinning.
2068;1;Dear anyone reading this, please reduce your curiosity about videos of people kissing on campus. This is an unfortunate part of East Asian culture—gossiping about others, especially when their behavior is considered bold—and it is harmful. Imagine if you were the one kissing, whether intentionally or not, whether willingly or being forced. If that video spread, you would feel embarrassed, right? So please, do not be curious and do not share it if such a thing happens. There is nothing for you to gain from watching a kissing video. You are only harming others. Besides, there are plenty of such scenes in Korean dramas and Western films. And for those of you reading this post, do not become more curious. Just stop now.
2069;1;What kind of country is Indonesia? Even to study the history of our own nation, the Indonesian language alone is not enough. It is important to learn Sanskrit, Javanese (and Old Javanese), Dutch, and English. It also helps if you know some Chinese and Arabic. This is because people from all over the world have come to our country and they are the ones who recorded things about us. We do not have many of our own historical records, and even those are often kept by other countries. Sometimes, we even have to go to Europe to access archives or Indonesian artifacts. It is truly insane.
2070;0;I am just an ordinary human being, imperfect and sometimes wrong, but in my heart there is only one thing: an extraordinary love for you.
2071;1;I get confused by people who are in a bad mood because of one subject—either because of the lecturer or the group—yet they skip other subjects that also have group assignments. The group still needs you, you know.
2072;1;Is it normal for a girl and a guy to often hang out together, use “I” and “you” in a romantic tone, call each other affectionate names, but have no official relationship status and are just friends? I feel like this is beyond the friend zone, is it not?
2073;1;It feels like we just had the inauguration yesterday, and now it is already almost time for our thesis...
2074;1;If I am sick, should I use my online attendance quota or just be marked absent?
2075;0;For those of you who interned as UI/UX designers, did you have to design both the UI and the animations, or just the UI? And which software did you use?
2076;0;Good luck to the class that is presenting.
2077;0;If he only reads my messages and does not reply, does that mean he is not interested in me?
2078;0;And everything was created in pairs so that you may remember the greatness of God. Oh Allah, with the hope of Your approval and blessings, please allow us to unite our children in a relationship in accordance with Your laws.
2079;1;Not the lecturer Not the subject All of them are clowns
2080;0;My crush is a nerd, my best friend is a nerd, my online friends are nerds, in fact I am also a nerd. I just love nerds so much.
2081;0;Good looks versus a good bank account. Which one is the winner?
2082;1;Only one midterm exam left, Compilation Technique.
2083;0;I want to ask, is it possible to get a free Coursera certificate for BINUS students, or is it paid?
2084;0;Oh, apparently you can already send private messages here? Try sending me one.
2085;0;Never get tired of being a good person. There is no loss in being kind.
2086;1;Sorry bro, I am not being mean, but if you did not respond to the group chat from the beginning and only replied when I was about to submit it, that is clearly intentional. I had no choice but not to include your name, so you can reflect on this for the future.
2087;1;I am curious if there are any seventh semester students here who still do not have a partner. Let us be mutuals so we can have someone to joke around and share our complaints with.
2088;1;Is it true that fourth semester will be fully onsite and there will no longer be Zoom classes?
2089;0;Let us be friends and hang out sometime. I just feel like meeting new people.
2090;1;If we accidentally input the wrong site supervisor, can we request access to edit it again?
2091;1;Spending Valentine’s Day alone for the third time.
2092;0;Type 1 if you feel that SUNIB is really bad at managing the class schedule.
2093;1;Please share the class Zoom link.
2094;1;Be careful with the male student from B24 with the initials NL. He borrowed millions from a fellow Binusian at Alam Sutera, saying it was urgently needed for COVID oxygen. But it has been over a month and he disappeared, even though he is from a wealthy family. Please help spread this.
2095;1;"Waiting for the final exam score feels like waiting for a message from my crush; it just never shows up."
2096;0;Go for it bro, they said they liked you.
2097;0;Why do I have the flu? Is it flu season?
2098;0;What is a French kiss? (This is a question, not a statement)
2099;1;This week, there will be many Suncur posts like “How was your first week of internship?”, “How was your fourth day of internship?”, stories of complaints, interesting experiences, and many other things. Meanwhile, for those who have not gotten an internship yet, it can be pressuring because others already have one, and when opening Suncur, there are many internship-related posts. It can lead to jealousy, sadness, depression, or a bad mood...
2100;0;There are two guys approaching me. One says I am beautiful, the other says I am funny. If we are just looking at it from the choice of words, which one is better: the one who says we are beautiful or the one who says we are funny?
2101;1;You are hurting me, but at the same time you are also keeping me alive.
2102;2;@Binus, please use our tuition fees to fix your website properly.
2103;1;2023, please be a good year.
2104;0;Is there a platform to find out the gossip at Binus?
2105;1;Has anyone from B23 graduated yet? I am a bit confused about the concept of graduating in 3.5 years.
2106;0;I want to rewatch Avatar 2 even though I just watched it yesterday. It was so good.
2107;1;It is only the first day and I already have two classes. It feels a bit overwhelming (it takes a lot of effort).
2108;2;I want to go back home and eat delicious food.
2109;1;"For those currently doing enrichment, is there anyone whose LP cannot be accepted and it says ""YOU HAVEN'T MAPPED WITH THE SUPERVISOR""? I already asked the SS and EPC, but there is still no response."
2110;1;I was invited to go to Nako, but my house is too far.
2111;0;Is there any information about webinars that add SAT points?
2112;2;Lately, the Suncur topics have been both sensitive and offensive. Please stop sending that kind of content and stop responding to such foolish posts. You are all educated and knowledgeable people.
2113;1;How do you find like-minded friends during this online era?
2114;2;I am really bad at small talk.
2115;0;Who is your favorite Corn Star?
2116;0;I want to ask, what food options are available at Binus Kemanggisan? I mean like dedicated places such as A&W, Starbucks, or anything like that? Can any Kemanggisan student share? Thank you, I want to surprise my friend who is studying there, but I am confused about what kind of food to get because I do not know what is available.
2117;0;It was so funny when my mom was wished a happy Chinese New Year by one of her employees, even though she is not Chinese. She did not know how to respond.
2118;1;I was reading some people's reactions to the earthquake on Twitter. Some were surprised that Indonesia has frequent earthquakes, and someone even linked it to the LGBTQ+ community. Regardless of whether that is true or not, I just find it funny—how can you live in Indonesia and still be surprised that earthquakes happen often? Earthquake drills should be mandatory in schools. (P.S. Japan, the United States, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Indonesia, and several other countries are located on the Ring of Fire, which is a high-risk earthquake zone. The upside of volcanic eruptions is that the ash makes the soil more fertile.)
2119;0;Does anyone have boarding house recommendations in the SCBD area?
2120;2;What is going on? It looks like the extended family is currently having a civil war.
2121;0;Hey, is there anyone here who works full-time while also attending regular classes? If there is, can you please give me some tips on how to manage the schedule?
2122;0;I was just proud of getting a good midterm grade, then I remembered it only counts for 20 percent... I need to work harder on the assignments.
2123;1;Do I truly love my parents, or is it only because of their money?
2124;1;None of my neighbors are decent. They borrow my motorcycle to go to the market almost every day, even though there are plenty of public transport options near my house.
2125;1;There is a girl in the same year as me who is tomboyish, likes edgy memes, and is very kind. She is extremely extroverted and friendly with everyone. She is very unique, I feel like she is out of my league. I think I am starting to like her, but when hinted at, she seems to generally not be interested in dating. What should I do?
2126;0;Seniors, I want to ask, for the internship program, is the company already provided by Binus? Is it not allowed to do it at the company where I currently work? Thank you.
2127;1;If you are the type of person who easily gets bored and you are dating a guy who cannot accompany you at all, what should you do? It feels like having a boyfriend but also not having one.
2128;1;I just told my mom about him, and I said we are still close even though we are actually not as close as we used to be. Please pray for me, my friends.
2129;1;When a guy is asked whether he likes a certain girl but never wants to answer honestly, what does that mean? Is it so he can talk to many girls at once? Or does he truly not like her, which is why he stays silent whenever asked? Please, guys, give me some clarity.
2130;2;There is a group project that must have exactly 3 people, no more. My class has 46 students, how does that make sense? I am the one left out. The lecturer told me to borrow a name and do the work alone, or else I will be considered as not wanting to continue the course. My motivation to study is gone, and so is my will to live.
2131;1;I still often argue with my own thoughts, how could I possibly have a relationship? We would not get along anyway.
2132;1;Those complaints that are full of anger are exhausting to look at. Why not settle things peacefully instead?
2133;1;My midterm grades have still not been released, unbelievable.
2134;0;Are all the replacement classes going to be onsite or online?
2135;1;"Have you ever had a friend call you ugly and say, ""No guy would want to be with you,"" only for you to find out that her own boyfriend is even less attractive? His face looks like a man's, and he only looks like a girl because he wears a headscarf."
2136;1;I want to expose how dirty and corrupted one of the departments in Binus is, starting from the head of the department to the lecturers and even the students. But who am I, just a powerless student. I would probably get expelled first... I guess I should just turn a blind eye?
2137;0;I want to try going to a psychologist. Does anyone have recommendations for a psychologist in the Alam Sutera area?
2138;0;What are the common roles for internships for Information Systems students?
2139;0;Is the Samsung Tab S6 Lite suitable for taking notes on campus?
2140;1;Back during the FYP, I tried to act friendly, but now I have gone back to being quiet. I can no longer force myself to be someone I am not.
2141;1;Everyone, if there is any new information about enrichment, especially internships, please share it on the student group. I found out about it way too late.
2143;1;My younger sister is a girl, and almost every boy at her high school has a crush on her. Meanwhile, her older brother—me—does not even get a chance. I get blocked right after I start typing.
2144;1;I have been too busy helping my friends understand coding that I have not learned anything new for myself. I lack rest and do not have time for my own hobbies. I do not know what to do.
2145;0;Is it allowed to wear a political party shirt to campus?
2146;2;Waiting in line for the elevator at Alam Sutera is absolutely ridiculous.
2147;1;Dear SunibGaming, you have received the attention you wanted. Now go live a real life—if you even have one to begin with—or go spend some time outside.
2148;2;I do not even know how to maintain a relationship anymore. Once I get upset, I can cut someone off immediately. My trust issues are extremely confusing. Sometimes I feel like I can trust people, and the next moment I find myself saying, “I hate everyone.” Again. For the thousandth time.
2149;1;Hello, could you share some tips to pass a student organization interview? Thank you.
2150;1;It is sad how some people only know how to hate and cannot appreciate other people’s achievements.
2151;1;Being a senior semester student is really exhausting.
2152;1;Is it true that in semester 6 we can only attend online classes a maximum of two times? I am from the 2024 batch and I am retaking a subject in semester 6, and I am really anxious about having to attend onsite classes with juniors. I feel embarrassed and I will definitely feel alone in class.
2153;1;The unpleasant part of being a woman in Indonesia like me is having to wait. I have to stay quiet when I feel comfortable with someone. I do not dare to express it because I am afraid the guy will pull away. But when I stay quiet, I worry that he might suddenly tell me he just asked another girl out. Please give me advice—what should I do now?
2154;1;I want to ask—do all classes have the same break time or different ones? If it is the same, then in semester 2 and onward we might still see our classmates from semester 1. But if it is different, then I guess that is just our fate.
2155;1;Guys, why does the water in West Jakarta smell bad?
2156;0;Have you ever met a classmate or someone really rich or famous at Binus?
2157;2;Damn everyone at Binus who decided to move the semester schedule earlier. You bastards who proposed that idea.
2158;2;Is it okay to just stay in my room when I do not have any classes? It seems like everyone else is always hanging out with their friends, and they have so many of them. It looks like almost everyone has a group of friends who are always ready to go out or shop together. Meanwhile, I only have one or two friends, and they are not the kind of friends I hang out with—they are just people I talk to when I feel overwhelmed, and we only meet once or twice a month. When it comes to grabbing coffee at a café or shopping, I usually go alone, and I am used to it. But seeing others always going out in groups makes me feel strange. I do not have anyone I can casually invite for coffee or shopping until we get tired of it. It feels like I have been abandoned by everyone.
2159;1;There are always those people whose ambition ends up making things harder for the whole class.
2160;1;I often get annoyed when I see spam comments about nearsightedness eye drops on Instagram.
2161;0;Have you ever felt like you chose the wrong university? If so, please share the reason why you felt that way.
2162;2;"In 2012, I still remember being mocked by the entire school, including the teachers, just because I did not have a Blackberry. It was so bad that I was even accused of stealing money from the school canteen. I clearly remember being confronted by parents and teachers in the teachers' office. My parents were scolded and blamed for not owning a car and so on. Then in 2022, when I was about to buy a new phone, I ran into a friend who used to mock and instigate others against me. He still remembered me. After I finished the phone transaction, he even walked me to the car park and said, ""Wow, you are amazing now. You even have a car. Teach me how you suddenly became successful."" I just walked away and replied, ""Well, thank you..."" It felt really satisfying somehow."
2163;2;The holiday is being spent working on GSLC, assignments, and final projects that are due in January.
2164;1;Please share tips and motivation for dieting, everyone. My weight is almost 100 kilograms. I want something that comes from myself, not because of a heartbreak or falling in love. I have tried everything, from intermittent fasting, keto, calorie deficit, and others, but I never seem to be able to stay committed. My problem is really with commitment, not with applying the diet itself.
2165;1;Still watching Korean dramas in the middle of the chaos of quizzes, project deadlines, and the final assignment.
2166;2;The maximum score is 90 but 90 is still an A-. The program runs 100% according to the requirements but is graded 80. That makes no sense. You are lowering my GPA.
2167;2;Seriously, how come after final exams we only get a few days off? Our minds and mental health have been pushed to the limit this semester. Please give us some proper rest, Sunib.
2168;0;Please share trusted Japan-Indonesia personal shopping services.
2169;1;As long as a guy has not been able to be with the girl he likes, those feelings will never go away, even if he is already with another girl.
2170;1;I really played the clown this year. I introduced my friend to another friend and ended up being left alone.
2171;0;Is Sunibgaming a boy or a girl? I am interested. Let us meet up.
2172;0;What would be good for an afternoon snack at Binus Syahdan?
2173;0;Please share information about coffee spots around Binus Alam Sutera.
2174;2;Yesterday I went to my grandmother’s house. She asked me what major I was studying. I said IT. Then suddenly she said, “Can you fix the washing machine?” As if I were some repairman who posts service advertisements on electric poles.
2175;0;How are you spending your Saturday night?
2176;1;Why do guys often refuse when a girl wants to buy or give them something? Is it out of pride?
2177;1;Can a class request to change the lecturer? Do we need a petition? How many signatures are required? Is there a procedure? Please give some information, for the sake of our future and our entire class.
2178;0;Please give recommendations for shoe laundry services near Kalideres.
2179;2;Hey, to those who keep disliking people’s comments, could you please stop disliking useful comments? Those comments are very important and informative, but they get disliked and end up buried. Lately, I have noticed that some people constantly receive dislikes even though their responses are important. If you do not like them, just ignore them, do not dislike the comments and make them disappear.
2180;0;Where is the Saturday night at home team? Let me hear your voices.
2181;0;Serious question, how do I delete a Suncur account?
2182;1;I swear, getting a final score of 89 hurts so badly, just one more point and I would have gotten an A.
2183;1;What is the most ridiculous excuse you have ever heard or read from your friend when they invited you to go out but suddenly you were “left behind”?
2184;2;This is so stupid, I have changed my thesis supervisor twice already. It feels like I am being toyed with by Binus. I also messaged the official account on the enrichment app about this incident, but no reply. Just watch, I will end up changing my supervisor every month. Truly messed up.
2185;1;"You asked what ""cepmek"" means? Yes, it means ""quickly falling in love with you"", but in reality, you do not love me back."
2186;0;Does anyone have experience in the management major at Binus? Any impressions or thoughts to share? I am considering transferring there.
2187;1;Do you think there are still companies willing to accept internship applications in January?
2188;2;I can barely manage being an academic ghostwriter while doing enrichment, but it is even harder to handle an internship alongside enrichment. Any tips on finding a money rain?
2189;2;Why are people so attractive while I am not? How can I ever get a girlfriend if I am not attractive?
2190;1;Please do not bully me, I am still a first-year student.
2191;2;I really do not know anymore, I am crying right now because I feel more and more exhausted being friends with someone who is depressed and mentally unstable. Please do not judge me... I care about them as a friend, and I have always been here for them for years. Because if not me, then who? They have lost all their friends because they always talk about themselves non-stop. I do not blame them, maybe it is just their personality to be very self-focused... But for me... every time I get a notification from them, I have to mentally prepare myself because it is always about their sadness and trauma. I did not expect I would end up feeling as tired as their other friends who left... At some point, I started avoiding their messages, rejecting invitations to meet, and so on, because I feel burned out in this friendship. They are a treasured friend, but slowly I am becoming unable to handle it... I keep crying because I also cannot bring myself to leave them... I do not want them to become even more depressed... I am sorry for venting at length here... I just had to get this off my chest but I have no one to talk to about it.
2192;2;Useless group members. They were a burden. I had already reminded them way ahead of time about today, and no one responded. On the actual day, none of them showed up. I had to do the presentation alone. That is just insane.
2193;0;What is going on at Binus Fess..... https://twitter.com/binus_fess/status/1608097386471251970
2194;0;What is the dumbest thing you believed when you were a child?
2195;0;What does it mean to dream about marrying your crush?
2196;0;Please share your study techniques.
2197;0;Guys, in your opinion, can LGBT people be “cured”?
2198;0;Tired of being single but also not interested when someone gets close, does anyone else feel the same?
2199;1;I miss the Suncur days when it was smalltomato, Libra, Bruno, eheh and others. Nowadays, Suncur is always full of drama, people grinding XP while leaving random comments, and if they fight, the arguments make no sense.
2200;0;I got black, I got white, what you want? Continue the lyrics.
2201;1;What do you think... Are people at university more individualistic? Do they care less about others? Back in school, everyone was more ambitious and had tight friend circles.
2202;1;At first, we were still using “lu-gue,” and just this morning, out of nowhere, he suddenly started speaking using “aku-kamu.” That is such a drastic change—what does it mean?
2203;2;Well man, your mouth is just full of nonsense.
2204;0;Please give me some recommendations for flu medicine, everyone.
2205;0;Has anyone here ever done an internship at PT Anabatic? Please share your experience.
2206;2;Hey, I am so bored. I really need a more exciting life haha.
2207;2;Sorry, I do not care if you say I hold grudges or whatever. But the fact is that I was subtly “pushed out” of my own friend group with the reason that I “do not fit in,” just because I am who I am. I honestly do not know what to do anymore. I really cannot hold it in—I want to talk about it. And if I am not allowed to do something, then why are you allowed? Huh?
2208;2;Sometimes I ask myself, “Why does she never notice me?” Even though I already know the reason why.
2209;1;Please, I really need tips on how to fall asleep. I have tried everything, but nothing has worked for me.
2210;0;Today is a nice date, 19-20-21. Do you not plan on making it something special?
2211;0;If your foot is numb, is it effective to use magic chalk on it?
2212;0;Big brother B22 with the initials BC, please be aware. I would like to get to know you better.
2213;0;From the Alam Sutera campus, if I have onsite class, how many minutes before class should I arrive? Twenty minutes? Is the elevator really crowded?
2214;0;Break your fast with someone who loves you, because just breaking it with someone sweet does not mean they love you.
2215;0;Is anyone holding an open house?
2216;0;Do you often take creative classes or regular classes?
2217;0;I used to think the term “campus escort” only referred to a few individuals, but it turns out that even in high-class places, it still applies. It seems that once people leave the first wave of education, things like this tend to happen and have become quite common, even though it is still a controversial topic, especially in this country, in this society.
2218;0;Please share study tips for basic statistics if you have taken the course. How do you understand the formulas?
2219;1;On the first day of internship, do you usually start working right away? I have been overthinking it since last Monday haha.
2220;0;God knows what is best for us. But sometimes, maybe the timing is not right yet. So, do not stop believing and hoping in God.
2221;2;That accounting thesis clinic event starts at 8 in the morning just to look for problems. How early do students from Alam Sutera and Bekasi have to wake up to head there?
2222;1;I should just do my internship at Mixue
2223;2;As a girl, I do not like being approached with the intention of becoming a girlfriend. I want a guy who really starts from friendship so it naturally matches. If someone wants to get to know me just to date, I would rather they not do it, because usually people who approach just to date move too quickly during the getting-to-know stage. I need to know you personally for at least a year. Is there anyone else who feels the same? I do have a boyfriend now and he is perfect. Do not give up, girls.
2224;2;Just got ghosted. Truly, college romance is just fiction.
2225;0;How can people afford to buy a Rubicon?
2226;2;I really regret being lazy to attend classes at the beginning of college. Now that we are not allowed to go to campus, I miss it so badly.
2227;2;Do I actually want to have a girlfriend because I really want one, or is it just because I feel lonely and need someone to talk to?
2228;0;When I started to lose feelings for my boyfriend, I suddenly had a dream where I married him and hugged his arm while leaning on him. I swear it was so random. But when I woke up, I felt like I was floating, and he acted like the most valuable person ever today. I fell in love with him again.
2229;1;In the end, people just compare who has it worse between older siblings and younger siblings, and vice versa. But every family has a different story, so as a middle child, I just stay silent and feel annoyed.
2230;0;How do I find or get GoFood, GrabFood, or ShopeeFood promotions? Or does anyone know any food places in Gading Serpong that often have promotions?
2231;1;The atmosphere around Binus feels very different, not like how it usually is.
2232;0;Is it allowed to use the Binus library meeting room to play games together?
2233;0;My friend lacks morals a little, inviting me to sleep over together
2234;0;wkwkqkwkwkwkkwkwkwwk
2235;0;For quizzes from lecturers at Sunib, what platform is usually used?
2236;0;For those of you who are in a relationship, what is your principle when it comes to paying? Equal split, fully paid by the guy, the guy pays more, or the other way around?
2237;2;Those of you who are antisocial, please do not hide in the toilet. I want to use it, seriously.
2238;0;For those of you here who have joined catechumen classes, how long did you attend?
2239;0;Hello everyone! Please help by filling out this questionnaire. There is an e-wallet prize of IDR 50,000.00 for 10 winners. Thank you. https://forms.gle/ksFQ8pUwPxHiY2qt9
2240;1;I thought he was extraordinary, but he turned out to be ordinary
2241;0;Happy Valentine’s Day to everyone. Those who have a partner, be grateful and take good care of your relationship. Those who do not, please be patient. You can still celebrate with your family. For people like me who live far from home, just hug your pillow tightly.
2242;2;Good evening, you over there. I miss you, but for some reason you always think I am joking. Haha
2243;0;Fresh wind, please come to the tired soul.
2244;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA
2245;1;I miss you right now.
2246;0;Are you all commuting from home or staying in a rented place during your internship?
2247;0;COVID cases are increasing, but why is Binus still fully onsite?
2249;0;I want to have a husband like Joe Taslim.
2250;1;The best fate is never being born, the second is being born but dying young, and the most unfortunate is living to old age. That is how it truly feels. Blessed are those who die young. – Quorawan
2251;2;It has been a while since the breakup, I thought I had moved on, but turns out...
2252;2;I am the type who prefers learning through Zoom recordings, and I cannot imagine how it would be when everything is fully onsite and there are no Zoom recordings anymore.
2253;0;What news is going around, why is everyone arguing?
2254;1;To all of you, especially the girls who walk to campus, please be careful. Now I understand why people say “harassment does not care about what you wear.” At that time, I was wearing a long shirt and a long skirt, not tight at all because I knew I had to dress modestly, especially since I walk and I knew it would not be 100 percent safe. But still, it happened anyway. Whether you are dressed sexy or not, tall or short, wearing a headscarf or not, perverts will still find a way to hurt you. And remember, this is not just a women's issue, men can also experience harassment, so this is a problem for all of us. For those of you who have experienced what I did, would you be willing to share how you deal with the trauma? I would be so happy if you could share it. (Maybe the admin of Sunib Curhat can post this on Instagram so more people can be aware.)
2255;2;Is it really necessary to finish the supervisor mapping today? Bimay is having an error again, this is so frustrating.
2256;2;Oh God, the economy is really tough right now. I was given a monthly allowance and there is only 10,000 rupiah left, and I still have to pay for internet, water, and other essential needs for the rest of the month. I feel so guilty to ask for more money from my parents.
2257;0;What is the update on the Sambo case? I have not heard anything about it for a long time.
2258;0;I want to ask, for B26, in which month is the graduation?
2259;0;Brother Arip is in a tough spot.. if he shares, people accuse him of teaching his followers to beg, but if he does not, they call him stingy.
2260;0;My resolution for 2023 is to find a soulmate, please. I am always single in this life, I need love.

2262;0;What does it feel like to be accepted when you confess your feelings to someone?
2263;0;How good is a 3.2 GPA?
2264;0;"I actually want ""mie tetek,"" come on."
2265;1;Why is it so hard to sleep? I do not even think I have insomnia.
2266;1;It is quite annoying when a friend acts all chill at first but ends up asking for answers.
2267;1;Are there midterms and final exams in the short semester? What is the difference between retaking a course in the short semester and in the regular semester?
2268;1;Honestly, Sunib Confession is not as fun as it used to be. I miss reading comments from Strong Girl, SkyandBeyond, Sanasinisenang, DKSRS who always made the comment section lively, and Bruno Mars who was once asked out. Sometimes, a single post had over thirty comments. Where did they all go?
2269;0;Will the final exams be held onsite or still online?
2271;0;Guys, if only one person submits in TFI, do all group members get the community service credit or just the one who submitted?
2272;1;Am I the only one who feels completely refreshed and free of worries right after receiving pocket money? Even though I was mentally stressed before…
2273;1;I have to be grateful for whatever grade I receive tomorrow.
2274;2;I do not know why, but ever since I was little, drinking coffee always made me even sleepier... Even so, I still drink it hoping it will help me stay up, but it only makes things harder.
2275;1;I spent the whole day lying on my bed, typing my final exam answers on my phone, and even submitting them from my phone. I hope God protects those of us who live the lazy life.
2276;2;What was taught and what came out on the exam are two completely different things.
2277;2;Exams that last only two hours are really stressful, please, it should be at least a day long.
2278;0;If a Flazz card is lost, do we have to pay again to make a new one?
2279;1;It is not nice being a girl. When I hear guys talk, I do not understand, but when I ask what it is, they say I am still innocent and better off not knowing. But they always talk about those things in front of me. How can I not be curious? And whenever I ask, they keep telling me to stay innocent.
2280;1;I feel insecure seeing that most of my classmates have gaming laptops.
2281;1;Social media exists to help us stay connected, not to compare lives or compete over who has it worse.
2282;2;How do you reject a guy who has been making an effort to get close without hurting his feelings?
2283;0;After hearing the news from the campus, it turns out that the February 13, 2023 start date was set by the government. So, it was not purely the campus's decision. That makes sense because if the campus wanted to change the schedule, they should have done it long in advance, not so close to the date. What would the campus even gain by changing the schedule at the last minute? Moreover, as we can see now, the campus is being bombarded with harsh comments, and they probably do not like that either. In any case, this situation is difficult for all of us, so let us support each other in getting through it.
2284;0;If it is going to be offline, does that mean there will no longer be any recorded lecture materials?
2285;1;I need a female friend to talk to if possible, ever since the pandemic nobody chats with me anymore.
2286;2;So two days ago, we had an algorithm and programming exam. Before the exam, I was really curious about who would be seated next to me (not for cheating purposes, just out of curiosity). Later, we entered the class, and I ended up sitting next to a girl I had never spoken to before. When the exam started, I spent around 5–10 minutes just reading the questions, while she began typing right away. It was a bit annoying because she typed so fast and loudly, as if she already knew the questions in advance. To be honest, about 50–60 percent of the class started typing immediately too. Thankfully, the university does not use mechanical keyboards. After understanding the questions, I started working on them quickly. Around 20–30 minutes in, I got frustrated with one of the questions and checked the web scoreboard to see who got it right. I noticed that the girl beside me was one of the students who solved one of the problems. For some reason, I was really amazed and even blushed a little, even though she was not the only one who got it right. I lost focus, started working on three problems at once, and ended up not finishing any of them. I almost solved one, but it was time-limited. I kept checking the scoreboard and eventually saw that she completed all four problems. I planned to get to know her and ask about the problem that frustrated me, and which class she would be in next semester. But I canceled that plan because I only solved one problem, and it was marked incorrect due to the time limit. That made me insecure, and I decided not to introduce myself. It was only on my way home that I realized I had developed a small crush on her. It is strange timing and a weird way to catch feelings. Has anyone else experienced something like this, or is it just me?
2287;1;I complained, but they did not care and only blamed me. Even when I asked for a solution like “what should I have done at that moment,” as one would expect from someone who has finished or is doing their thesis, I was still not given any advice. The reason? Jealousy from other students.
2288;0;I waited for them for two years, and now they are finally back with me again.
2289;0;After doing assignments, I opened Sunib Confession, and there is another drama. Nice.
2290;0;Tomorrow is the final exam, and it weighs 50 percent.
2291;1;For those who are not used to multitasking: during the seventh semester enrichment program, I suggest choosing the alternative track, because at that time you will be handling enrichment app assignments, writing your thesis proposal, and also preparing the final report all at once. If you want to do an internship, choose the 4-month option so you will have time to rest, complete assignments, write your proposal, and your final enrichment report. If you are good at multitasking, it is okay to choose the 6-month internship, but only if you are ready to handle all of that at once.
2292;0;For those of you who received a bouquet from your friends during your thesis defense, did you send one back to them during theirs?
2293;1;Since online learning started, it feels like we have more assignments than actual lectures. Sorry, but how come there can be more than five GSLC sessions in one week, yet there are no video conferences? I might as well just pay Google to teach me.
2294;0;There are eight billion people in the world, but the only one I like is you.
2295;0;"Who is the ""male 19"" that keeps saying ""male 19""?"
2296;0;Imagine if a murderer said “I want you to the bone,” it would be terrifying. But if Pamungkas said it, it would instantly sound sweet.
2297;0;We are all just side characters in the world of SunibGaming.
2298;2;Why are the earthquake and wind so weak? Might as well bring a tornado and tsunami while you're at it.
2299;0;Type 1 so that your final exam score can be 100.
2300;2;As far as I know, wearing a crop top on campus is still acceptable. It does not bother me either. Do you really think it looks that inappropriate? Most people who wear crop tops also wear high-waisted pants, so it still covers things up. It is rare to see someone lifting their arms too. But I have noticed that people who wear crop tops and look a bit more revealing usually have a larger chest, so maybe it is not the crop top but the body type. If that is the case, then you cannot really forbid it. In my opinion, the people who wear crop tops still dress within reasonable limits. Personally, I prefer baggy clothes, so I never wear crop tops. But my best friend wears them often—not for any specific reason, she is just really short, so certain outfits can make her look awkward. She also hates tucking in her shirt because she is just that carefree. So as long as it is a regular crop T-shirt and nothing extreme, just let them be. The professional world will eventually make them realize what is appropriate.
2301;0;Has anyone here ever taken a leave of absence from university? Could you share your experience and what happened when you returned?
2302;0;What do we usually do in the CB Comserv assignments in semesters 2 and 3?
2303;0;Can someone share which lecturers in the Alsut department are known to be strict and which ones are kind?
2304;1;Is there anyone who has not gotten an internship at all? If you still have not gotten one by February 9, what will you do?
2305;2;Everyone, in my opinion regarding the post on Twitter about the opposite of Binus, we do not need to make it go viral outside of Binus. It is enough if only we know about it. I mean, it does not mean we are not aware, but if it really is like that, we should just report it directly to the part of Binus that is responsible for handling such cases internally. Also, my suggestion for those who recorded the video: you are university students, not high school students. You should be critical and not passive. You should have the courage to criticize lecturers if the lecturers are indeed at fault. We also need to consider the long-term impact if this issue goes viral. Especially since we are from a private university, and as you know, the public already has certain stigmas about “private universities” in Indonesia. Binus worked hard to achieve accreditation, and yet society still looks down on it. The future impact is that our university might be labeled negatively, given strange reputations, and this will also affect us when we mention our alma mater or when we enter the corporate world.
2306;2;I am really annoyed seeing this one person saying they do not understand the job suggestion system. You are a university student, you can read the guidelines from the download center. What have you been doing during your studies? And now your friends and EPC are not even willing to entertain your request.
2307;0;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2308;0;Hello, I want to ask, does anyone know where to request a certificate stating that you did not receive a scholarship?
2309;1;What is so hard about responding in the group chat? Just replying with “okay” is enough, it does not take much effort.
2310;0;Binus! Let us place an order for Christmas cookies. They can also be packaged according to your request. http://bit.ly/MenuNNCookie Cash on delivery available at KMG, or delivery through Grab and Gojek. https://linkr.bio/NNCookie Thank you Iann, have a nice day.
2311;0;I am hoping that in 2023 I will meet my soulmate, because in the previous years I have been single for 21 years.
2312;0;During the short semester, are we in the same class as students from the lower batch?
2313;0;I am sorry, friends, if it sounds like I am showing off. But I really want to share this story. Today I was so happy to attend classes together with my friends. From running to campus in the morning because we were afraid of being late, facing a sudden quiz together, feeling nervous when submitting a group project, to going home together. We even had debates with the lecturer about the course material. It was so fun with lots of laughter, although we often felt confused and stressed too. I hope you all can experience something like this as well.
2314;0;You think love is only about laughter and jokes. You asked me to be sweet and then left just like that, disappearing without a trace.
2315;2;I was playing solo rank and got matched with a trio who picked all marksmen. So we ended up with 1 mage, 1 exp laner, and 3 marksmen. Why do people enjoy ruining other people's fun? I hope every day feels like Monday for you all.
2316;1;I want to ask, if the B24 free electives worth 4 credits are failed, when will the short semester take place? And if we fail a free elective, are we allowed to change the subject? Also, will the lecturer change, or will it be the same lecturer who failed us teaching again?
2317;0;How much does it cost to hire someone to do the community service program?
2318;2;For those who have already done the first batch of onsite classes, does that mean we cannot join the second batch anymore? I really miss attending classes onsite. Is Binus not going to allow more onsite sessions?
2319;1;Has anyone else experienced a system error when trying to apply for a job on the internship website? Or is it just me?
2320;2;Please, seniors who are retaking the basic calculus course, those who dress up like they are going to a fashion show, and always come late — you are being a disturbance. Stop acting so rude. You should be ashamed in front of your juniors. You are already repeating the course, yet you show no sense of responsibility. I feel like pinching you out of frustration.
2321;0;I swear, Across the Spider-Verse has such amazing animation that I watched it twice.
2322;0;Have a great day, stay safe, and remember that you will get through this.
2323;1;I have reached the point where I am tired of explaining everything. If he truly wanted to, he would.
2324;1;Hey, is there anyone who wants to do the community service program together? I need 10 more points. Let me know by dropping your Discord username below.
2325;2;What can a stupid person like me even do? I am only good enough to be trash.
2326;2;Thank you for teaching and showing me what parasitic symbiosis in a friendship looks like.
2327;0;How can we do the SOCS OJ assignments without anyone asking us for answers?
2328;1;Do not forget to get married! Do not get too comfortable being alone, because your income tax will be higher if you do not have marriage or child tax deductions.
2329;2;This is so unclear and messed up. (Censored for language)
2330;2;When you and your partner are both unable to force each other... That is so funny, seriously, neither of you can set any boundaries.
2331;2;Back in school, I really wanted to go to college as soon as possible, but now that I am actually experiencing it, college turns out to be very difficult...
2332;0;Does “Netflix and chill” actually have a negative connotation?
2333;1;SAT claim: Using course certificate no, Using seminar certificate yes Binus, of course.
2334;0;I really enjoy talking about high school memories with old school friends. Looking back, we were all so silly, always getting into trouble. I am very lucky the pandemic started before my national exams in 12th grade, so I can still say that I experienced the fun of high school.
2335;1;I want to ask something. When you bring a friend to your room or boarding house, is it normal for them to suddenly open your wardrobe without asking first? I feel uncomfortable with people who just take or open things without permission, even if we are close.
2336;0;Hi, I want to ask those who have done internships before. If you are assigned for 5 months, is it possible to stop early and make it only 4 months?
2337;1;Please help me, it has been raining and flooding nonstop.
2338;0;Mega, why are you like this?
2339;2;How do we forgive ourselves? How do we make peace with ourselves? How do we get out of this darkness? I want to be free... I am already tired. Many people have said those things to me, but no one ever tells me how.
2340;0;What is the usual reason you deactivate Instagram?
2341;0;Let us pray that Nirwana Selle's good deeds are accepted and that she is granted a place in Allah's paradise. Amen.
2342;1;Why must people come and go? Is it not possible for someone to just stay?
2343;2;Is it okay to not be mentally okay? Is it wrong to not be okay? Is it wrong to seek help from close friends? I am definitely not okay and very lonely. I am not joking at all. This loneliness has led me into depression.
2344;0;Looking for sm.........
2347;1;Already looked at the question -> confused and blank -> on the way to sleep in an uneasy state
2348;1;It is nice since the new Binus Maya exists, but it is very complicated. Assignments must be submitted to the old Binus Maya, while the forum is in the new Binus Maya. It is a bit complicated, why not just like the old system where everything is in one place so it would not be troublesome?
2349;2;https://sunibcurhat.com/post/61ZkW7/admin-suncur-standar-ganda Aww, still upset because your fourth account got banned? You played stupid games, and you won the stupid prize. The admin of this site can definitely see the username behind every post. They already made the terms and conditions clear. They cannot enforce rules if they cannot see the accounts behind these so-called 'anonymous' posts. That one user was extremely rude, but at least they never attacked others by revealing initials, major, and class year. Your apology did not even seem sincere, you had someone else deliver it (even though it was the same account). Just accept the loss and move on, do not do something foolish again with your fifth account.
2350;2;Because of the pandemic, I have been studying online. Every day my parents tell me I am useless just because I stare at my laptop and phone a lot. Even though it is obviously because of college. When I try to explain, they do not believe me, and in the end, they compare me to other young people who are already successful.
2351;2;I need advice. Last year I studied one semester in IT at Sunib, but I resigned due to choosing the wrong major and some personal reasons. This September, I just started again at a new university, taking hospitality, but it also feels like the wrong choice. I dread going to campus so much. Every time I think about class, I feel anxious and terrible. I have even skipped several classes. I plan to take the university entrance test again next year, and now I feel like resigning again. But I do not know how to tell my parents. I am afraid to disappoint them a second time. However, if I continue in hospitality, I do not think I will survive, because waking up to attend class already feels like such a heavy burden. I need opinions from other people's perspectives.
2352;0;Guys, if we want to ask about payments and such, should we consult SSC or LSC? It is SSC, right?
2353;0;Is there anyone who also wants to register for IISMA?
2354;2;Let us see if you can think clearly. Suppose A always asks B for help, and B always helps A. After being helped, A just acts like nothing happened and does not say thank you. Because of that, B gets angry. Who is at fault? Is it A for not being grateful, or B for sounding insincere with their help?
2355;1;Yesterday someone brought up how people with high GPAs get criticized because others cannot apply for scholarships, or for various other reasons. But the point was that it is okay to have a low GPA, do not feel discouraged. And for those with high GPA, they should be responsible for their knowledge. It would be embarrassing if during a job interview your GPA is high but during the test, you know nothing. Then someone asked to reveal their lowest grade and got called out for flexing. What do people actually want? Everything is wrong in your eyes.
2356;0;Any information on male/mixed boarding houses around Kemanggisan? It is 13 days before college starts and I still have not found a place to stay.
2357;0;Hello. Regarding your connection complaint, please try the following steps first: Ensure the patch cord (black or yellow cable with blue ends) is properly connected. Wait until the Power, PON/LINK, Internet, and Wi-Fi lights on the modem are on. Then try to connect: Using LAN cable: Make sure the cable is properly plugged into LAN port 3 on the modem. Using Wi-Fi: If the Wi-Fi light is off, press the Wi-Fi button until it lights up. If the issue persists, please contact us again so we can follow up. – Fa***l

2363;0;Seniors who are about to graduate or anyone who knows, I would like to ask. I once read that you can graduate from undergraduate studies without writing a thesis if you publish a journal. Is that applicable at Binus? And aside from publishing a journal, what's the other way? Thank you.
2364;1;what requirements are there for binus graduation?
2365;2;Oh my gosh, a guy just invited me to Bandung, just the two of us, and even wants to stay overnight.
2366;1;I feel like crying. I am already this age and I still cannot make friends.
2367;1;"This morning I took my girlfriend out. She was the one who wanted to go, so I agreed. But when we got to her house, she said, ""Is this your motorcycle? Why does it sound weird? Like a car, and ugly."" That really hurt, honestly."
2368;2;Why does it take so long to open Binusmaya, and why do we have to fill in the lecturer questionnaire first? I just want to submit an assignment, but I have to wait for Binusmaya to finish loading.
2369;2;Boom, the questions are so different from what was taught in class. This is unbelievable.
2370;1;Hello. I want to ask, how do I distance myself from an ex who keeps chasing after me, but in a polite way that does not hurt them? Any advice, everyone?
2371;0;Is cuddling forbidden?
2372;1;Because of internship issues, everything is a mess. My Computer Vision final assignment, which is due tomorrow afternoon, is not done. I have not even touched the Binus exam after the onsite OS test. I am scared to look ahead. Life feels directionless. Help.
2373;0;Sometimes I feel ashamed of myself. I am already in semester 5 and still do not have many friends. I see others enjoying time with their friends and joining different activities. Meanwhile, I am here always scared to form a group because I always end up being the outcast. I just want to give some advice: do not be afraid to talk to people, meet new people, and join activities or organizations, because the feeling of regret hurts.
2374;0;Is the intern salary the same for all positions, or does it vary?
2375;1;Here we go again, this person is acting up. It is fine to be ambitious, but do not step on other groups. Just because you are older than all of us does not mean you can do whatever you want.
2376;2;Smiling face
2377;0;I have been sentenced as a defendant, for stealing your heart. And the punishment is to love you for the rest of my life.
2378;0;Guys, during which semester does the internship usually happen? And if the company is in a different city, is that allowed?
2379;1;Is having a job, earning money, and not being a burden to your parents something to be proud of to the point where you look down on those who are still unemployed and dependent on their parents?
2381;2;Why have I still not gotten an internship? This is so frustrating.
2382;2;I want to ask my crush out to a place, and honestly I am extremely nervous while waiting for her answer. Sometimes I am afraid I will come across as too aggressive and make her lose interest. But she once said she is totally fine with girls making the first move. Ah, I am so confused and nervous.
2383;0;First day of internship. How do I fill out the logbook? Is there a template?
2384;0;Serious question: if the lab group has already been registered, can I request to work solo again to the assistant? Because the others always go silent when asked questions.
2385;1;I thought it was you calling, but it turned out to be the delivery guy.
2386;0;That was it? Only four questions? It was so easy. I just guessed and finished in less than an hour. I do not get why others are struggling. Just write something on the paper and leave. Whether it is correct or not can be dealt with later. Whatever.
2387;0;Guys, I want to ask, until when will the internship jobs on the enrichment portal of the Binus app be available?
2388;0;Finally, the tears that have not come out for months have finally fallen. Stay strong, friends who are still not lucky enough to get an internship. Maybe it is just not the right time yet. God bless!
2389;0;Do you all remember that we had a friend named Risya who is handsome?
2390;1;New year, same depression, same anxiety, same problems, same pressure—or maybe all of it is even worse than last year.
2392;2;Dear God, looking for ComServ hours feels like searching for a needle in a haystack. Or am I just being stupid?
2393;1;Any info about someone offering to take the CompNet class for others? Just kidding.
2394;2;My butt really hurts from the chairs at Alsut.
2395;2;Is your mental health okay? You have already been caught by SOD but still want to lie. Truly impressive. Stay strong!
2396;0;Does BCA Alsut close early on Fridays?
2397;1;Just live life according to the flow, you know! I do not want to overthink anymore!
2399;0;I was not the one who made that post about sex. I am a different 24-year-old guy haha. (I am the one who posted about the album recommendations.)
2400;1;Deep down I know we are not meant to be together, but I already like him so much. What should I do? I cannot just stop liking him.
2401;1;It smells like a breakup is coming because of graduation. Well, maybe it is because they are no longer needed to supply exam and assignment answers, oops.
2402;0;Does Discrete Math have a final project?
2403;0;Guys who are six feet tall, please leave a comment, darling.
2404;2;Oh my goodness, I opened up about deep personal matters to a very close friend and it turns out they told others about my problems. The person I least expected and trusted... I ended up crying so hard.
2405;2;Please help boost this. Does anyone have info on private or semi-private tutoring for computer science courses? If there is, please share the info.
2406;0;The type of girl I like wears glasses, has a ponytail or short hair, is out of touch with trends, quiet, likes to be alone, does not have many friends, shy, a bookworm, not social, and is often avoided by others. My friends say I am weird—am I really?
2407;2;Why does today feel like a double kill? Why?
2408;0;Please give some tips for freshmen majoring in Information Systems. Thank you!
2410;2;He is intelligent and everything, but too self-centered. Although he does not treat me that way, and he is not someone who flatters with sweet words so he remains logical—which I appreciate because he knows I dislike sweet talkers. However, the way he treats other people… I cannot stand him.
2411;1;Does anyone know a good source for learning algorithms? I find the materials from the university itself are not sufficient to solve the daily quiz questions.

2415;0;What is the difference between an AoL exam and a regular exam?
2416;1;Seven out of eight, yay. But why are there so many subjects this semester? I remember the previous posts on the curriculum page showed only about five or six courses on average.
2417;2;This week, the Learning Support Center has been extremely crowded with students who are not eligible for their final exams due to excessive absences—including myself.
2418;0;Today is graduation day for many people. I hope I can graduate on time next year as well, amen.
2419;0;Wow, I am so happy my GPA is 4.5. I can finally get some sleep.
2420;2;Those who have already cried on the first day of 2023, raise your hand so I do not feel too pathetic.
2421;2;Until when can we file a grade complaint? Do we need evidence to prove that it was not our fault to avoid a deduction of 20 points? (Like a chat with the lecturer?) What is the procedure for filing a grade complaint?
2423;1;My life feels as dry as the world itself, barren and without love.
2424;1;Please, Binus, just remove the survey. It really gets in the way when trying to open other things, and when I try to fill it out, it is slow.
2425;0;Serious question: is scholarship mentoring only short-term? Like just for one semester? I saw on LinkedIn that many Binus students had it that way. Also, is it possible to get the scholarship in semester 3 or 4?
2426;1;I wonder if the rector of Sunib even uses the curriculum portal. It feels like there have been so many complaints, but nothing is being addressed.
2427;0;Finally, the curriculum portal can be accessed on desktop again.
2428;1;Is a four-year age gap considered significant?
2429;0;For a long time, Nala has felt difficult to like…
2430;0;Have you ever felt like you are likeable, but not loveable?
2431;0;I want to meet Sunibgaming in real life.
2432;0;What subjects do Information Systems students get? Is there mathematics and coding? Or is it more focused on UI/UX?
2433;1;Why is it that when you join a circle of friends, you are expected to greet each other, wait for each other, and say goodbye before going home?
2434;1;Do girls really like to provoke on purpose? For example, when talking one-on-one, why do they sometimes mention another guy?
2435;1;I was really happy to have a Zoom call with you. Even though I was very tired doing your assignment while you just stayed silent.
2437;0;After Sunda Empire, now comes Angling Dharma. When else would you see a king's coronation based on a dream? That already beats fairy Mimi.
2438;2;To those who like to press dislike, you are so annoying. People are just sharing their feelings and there is no reason to dislike it, yet someone still does. I hope those who randomly dislike everything always have terrible internet.
2439;2;If the midterms are already like this online, what more will the final exams be like onsite?
2440;1;It is so exhausting to have a hobby of missing people.
2441;1;I am at a stage where I need someone to talk to, but at the same time I want to be alone.
2442;0;If you want to make a university ranking, please interview students honestly, and then see where Binus ranks.
2443;1;I cannot be alone.. but when we are together, I suffer.. The truth is, we are not fine at all.. (very relatable)
2444;1;Is there anyone who plays Point Blank? Let’s play together, I am bored of playing alone. Please write your nickname in the comments.
2445;1;I do not even dare to touch it, but you forced me to admit I tried that drug. You are ridiculous.
2446;0;You are truly mature if you do not see a person’s physical appearance as the foundation of your love and affection.
2447;2;Wow, the Sunib exam website was extremely slow one minute before the deadline, I almost did not get to submit.
2449;0;Hello, you who study Business Law, a greeting of longing from me, a Psychology student.
2450;2;Forget fake friends.
2451;0;Let’s go to Gran Melia bar for New Year’s Eve.
2452;0;Can anyone give a testimony for those in Information Systems, semester 4, who chose the ERP specialization?
2453;2;Finally the final exam for this difficult subject is ongoing. I managed to find the answers for two questions in three hours, but they are still messy.
2454;0;Check-in, how many of your final exams have you completed? Sender: 5 out of 6!
2455;1;I finally speedran my casebook and it is done. The casebook battle for semester 1 is over.
2456;2;I want to express my feelings, but I am afraid they will distance themselves and we will no longer be friends.
2457;1;What is going on? They said internship acceptance info would be given within two weeks, but it has been three weeks and there is still no update at all. If we are not accepted, they should update the intern app so we can apply to other companies. Can we file a complaint about this?
2458;0;How do you approach a girl from Binus?
2459;2;When we are in a relationship with certain people, we often reflect their attitude back to them. Today I tried that with my family, and coincidentally I was in a very bad mood. They got angry. I mean, I love my family, but sometimes they need to be aware of how they appear in the eyes of others.
2460;1;I'm afraid that you will end up hating me too.
2461;1;Is it really normal for someone who is already in a relationship to still be confused over their ex? My boyfriend's ex does that, and honestly at first I was upset, but over time I started to feel sorry for her. Like, stop. You already have a partner, and so does your ex.
2462;1;I do not really like friendships in college. Everyone tends to form cliques. I feel bad for people who are not considered fun because they end up alone. Sometimes I overthink, like, “Is it because I am not fun that I do not have a circle?” When I feel anxious during class, I usually go to the toilet to be alone for a while.
2463;1;I wanted to fill out the parent’s permit, but I could not submit it because it said the name must be in alphabet characters. I already entered it in alphabet. Has anyone else experienced this?
2464;2;Honestly, one of the anonymous posts about racism in Malang was right. This morning I got into a fight because someone yelled a slur at me based on my religion and accused me of being LGBT. I am not even from here, and it escalated to the point where I was bleeding, and my parents had to come outside. This city is so racist. My father is now going to discuss the matter with the local community leader. It is insane. I was already late for campus, and to make it worse, the community leader defended the person who yelled at me like it was no big deal. Seriously, I would rather go back to my hometown. This is too much.
2465;0;My friend has high hopes every time it is their birthday.
2466;2;At first, we took a group photo together. Then they asked me to take the photo for them. Turns out the one they uploaded did not include me. Wow, seriously?
2467;2;I am already overwhelmed with relationship problems, and now I am also dealing with family issues, financial problems, and college. Too many problems at once.
2468;0;For those from Social Sciences who are interning at BCA, is there really still no group? There are only three weeks left.
2469;0;Seriously asking, what is going on with oil? In my city everything seems normal, there is no chaos or anything.
2470;1;Finally, one company invited me for an interview... after such a long time.
2471;0;Guys, should I buy the shoes I really like, or the ones I feel so-so about but know I will wear often because they are easier to match with my outfits?
2472;0;I am currently forming a work team, in case anyone is interested in joining. It is perfect for those looking to earn some extra money. If anyone wants to join, feel free to comment. Thank you.
2473;2;Wow... I like you, not her. Please be a little more aware, do not be so narrow-minded.
2474;1;I hope what I am thinking does not actually happen.
2475;2;Guys, is it still possible to register for classes? I forgot that there is a subject I have to retake. Now it is already semester 6, do I really have to retake it in semester 8? I am so stressed.
2476;2;I was already stressed working on my midterms, then when I tried to de-stress by playing games, I got scolded by my mom because I kept playing. She said, 'All challenges must be faced.' Yes, but not all at once. How about you focus on your own wedding first before telling others to 'face the challenge.' I know the intention is good, but not every challenge has to be taken on at the same time.
2477;1;Is it wrong to fall for someone who is already in a relationship?
2478;0;Guys, for tomorrow's onsite class, will it be divided or will the whole class attend? For example, yesterday it was hybrid with 20 onsite and 20 online. So tomorrow will it be all 40 onsite or divided into 2 groups?
2479;1;"Good evening, Has anyone here ever had COVID? I want to hear directly from someone who has experienced it. So yesterday after I got home, I suddenly had a fever, sore throat, and a cold (this was on Sunday, the 11th). Then the next morning (Monday, the 12th), my body felt a bit better but I could not taste anything. Everything tasted bland. Drinking water made me feel nauseous, but juice had a taste. Mint candy also had taste. Eating Siomay tasted bland, but I could still taste the peanut sauce. However, I could still smell things. Could this be considered COVID?"""
2480;1;I have this strong urge to pull back again. It always happens when I feel like I am getting too close to someone.
2481;0;Oh, there is another commotion. This is exciting.
2482;1;Sometimes after finishing FEP and ESSE, we drift apart from the FL seniors. We used to meet often in ESSE class, now we rarely do. I still stay close to a few seniors, but why does my own FL senior not stay close with me (even though we live in the same boarding house)? She said she is busy with assignments. Well, we never know how busy someone is. I always wait for the time she is free. I just want to hang out like normal friends, not like senior and junior. 'I miss my senior.' (Unfortunately, she does not follow Sunib.)
2483;0;Guys, for those who have done internships, is there usually a work contract of 3 to 6 months, or is it more flexible?
2484;1;Having a relationship openly is already difficult, let alone having a secret one.
2485;0;I enjoy quarrels like this. Come on, fight again.
2486;0;If I do not get an internship, will I be moved to another track or is there an alternative track?
2487;0;D3333 D3333 D3333
2489;1;Admin... I miss the person who once left a scar in my heart.
2490;1;One night I had dreams with various storylines, but the one thing I remember is that at the end of the dream, I cried and screamed loudly. When I woke up, my chest hurt. Does this mean I have reached the peak of my depression?
2492;1;I went to Jakarta out of boredom with the intention of working a part-time job, but it turns out everything is closed due to PSBB. I need a friend who wants to share ideas about producing or mixing music... Play it now.
2493;1;Please share any webinar information, friends. Thank you very much, it would really help.
2494;2;2 out of 6 final exams are done.
2495;0;Does anyone know a good source for learning algorithms? I find the material from Sunib itself is not enough to solve the quizzes from day to day.
2496;2;When you act too cold and hard to get: people are scared or lazy to approach, or you are just treated like a bet. When you try to lower your ego and stop being cold: you end up being taken advantage of and seen as too easy. When you are too friendly: people take you for granted because you are not challenging and easy to get__ So do not ask why __
2497;1;I just saw my ex kissing someone. Should I just jump off the balcony?
2498;0;Do you prefer Alsut or Kemanggisan, everyone?
2499;1;"Sorry, say whatever you want, call me resentful or anything. But the fact is that I was subtly ""pushed out"" from my own circle with the excuse that I ""did not fit in"", just because I am who I am. I honestly do not know what to do anymore. I really cannot hold it in, I want to talk about it. And if I am not allowed, why are you allowed? Huh?"
2500;1;Still turning my DND light red even though I am on Zoom alone.
2501;1;It feels like a waste to pay tuition fees. All we get are GSLC tasks and assignments. There are even fewer video conferences. It is frustrating.
2502;0;Let us keep the spirit up, there are still two final exams left.
2503;0;Since the 2010 World Cup, nothing has been as exciting.
2504;0;"Where can I get broken glasses repaired around Lippo Karawaci or Gading Serpong? The break is not too bad; it can still be fixed. Any suggestions?"
2505;1;When someone opens up to me, how am I supposed to respond? I can only be a listener, but when it comes to giving advice and all that, I really cannot do it. Haha
2506;1;"A Binus student asked, ""Why was the start of the semester moved earlier?"" SSC immediately went silent and acted blind, refusing to reply. Meanwhile, other chats were being answered. Rest in peace, Sunib haha."
2507;0;For those who did not get accepted through SBMPTN, remember that everyone has their own storyline and role. Keep playing the game, a good ending is waiting for you.
2509;1;Do you want to have beautiful eyelids but your wallet is already empty? Easy, it only takes a week to make your dream come true of having beautiful eyelids, no surgery involved. Just cry regularly for a week, and then your eyelids will form naturally and beautifully. No need for eyelid tape, let alone surgery, because it is expensive.
2510;1;Alright then, maybe next time it will be for me.
2511;2;I am so exhausted, seriously, semester 5 is draining me so badly that my appetite has dropped drastically. I cannot even touch the food in front of me because I feel so nauseous.
2512;1;It started with asking about the material, then about the method, and I already suspected where this was going. Turns out I was right, they asked for the answer. What should I do about this?
2513;0;"Has anyone read this? I am really shocked that the perpetrator is a Hotel Management student from Kemanggisan. https://twitter.com/stillunsilenced/status/1620354005552738304?s=46&t=COBn5gbZxtO2wvyIXHORlw"""
2514;2;To all the girls, if you already have a boyfriend, then say so. Do you think guys are mind-readers who can magically know? When we approach and you respond and give hope, that is just cruel.
2515;2;Please share some tips on how to move on, seniors.
2516;1;Is it okay if I text my crush first? I want to start the conversation, but I am afraid it will seem like I am desperate. But from the way he acts, it seems like he also has feelings for me. So I am confused.
2517;1;Why is my mother always thinking negatively about my boyfriend? It is true that my boyfriend is not from an upper-class family, but my mother always thinks that he is trying to take advantage of my parents' money. Sometimes it makes me sad when my parents talk like that.
2518;0;I have a lot of friends, but I am not really attached to one particular group. Now that I want to go out with someone, I realize I do have many friends. What do you think— is it important to have a close friend circle? Because from what I have seen, friend circles sometimes turn into cliques or exclusive groups.
2519;0;Let us all start submitting the midterm assignments, especially B25, do not wait until the last minute. According to my FM2's story, they had never received assignments before, so maybe they did not know that even if you are late by one second, it will be considered expired. Luckily, now they understand. I hope the others know too. Do not miss the deadline, guys!
2520;0;Enjoy all the ups and downs of college life. We only get three years of being in class together with our friends, crushes, and others. After that, it is enrichment, and we only meet again at graduation. I kind of regret some things— do not mind me.
2521;1;For those of you who go to the gym but have a tight budget for food, it is better to focus on earning money first. Rather than getting tired and still ending up with a bad body shape. I see a lot of people like that in Kemanggisan.
2522;1;For friends at Binus Senayan and Bekasi, do your campuses have auditoriums or rooms that can be used for concert-type events? If so, please let me know. My event could not get the Anggrek auditorium, and the one in Alam Sutera is too small. I want to try borrowing from another Binus region in case they have space.
2523;0;When will LSC start operating again?
2524;0;Was there an earthquake? Did anyone feel it?

2527;1;GPA is above 3.5 but still not eligible for cum laude. It hurts in a way that cannot be seen.
2528;1;There is always a problem. Right when there are many final projects, my laptop breaks. I am a computer science student and currently living in a boarding house, so I do not have a PC... And my family's financial condition is currently difficult, so I feel reluctant to tell my parents... Thankfully, I had already backed up all my files, so I do not have to redo everything from the beginning.
2529;1;I often feel confused about students from that university, they make fun of our campus by saying it looks like Mangga Dua, but they keep posting pictures of the building and tagging it as Mangga Dua. You do not even know that a neighboring campus looks way more like Mangga Dua, yet they never tag or badmouth their campus. Are they actually proud that their campus looks like Mangga Dua?
2530;2;Hey, if you are given a responsibility, do not run away from it. You are getting older but still have no manners.
2531;1;I swear, you are really cruel.
2532;0;Let us be mutuals on Twitter. I just recently started using Twitter. Drop your Twitter username, and I will follow you later.
2533;1;When is the next schedule for KRS registration?
2534;1;Can I get an internship through divine intervention? I am really afraid I will not get one or will be moved to another track.
2535;1;I have a partner, but it still feels like I am alone.
2536;2;When will you open your eyes to all my efforts? It is obvious that he is not interested in you, yet you still keep chasing him. It would be a different story if he were interested— I would fully support you both. Please open your eyes. There is someone here who really loves you— who brings you food when you are broke and hungry, who stays with you when you are moody, who listens to all your stories and complaints, who supports you when you are trying to become a better person, and so on. But if chasing him makes you happy, then that is okay. I will still be here for you whenever you need a friend.
2537;0;Why is my TikTok filled with capybaras on my For You Page all of a sudden?
2539;1;You are the one writing a thesis, but I am the one who is stressed.
2540;0;Finally done with final exams, thank God.
2541;0;Does anyone know the Instagram of that civil engineering guy from TikTok? Please help.
2542;2;"Class starts at 9:20, but before it even hits 9:20 my mom already starts nagging, ""See, not going to class again, it is already this late, you cannot get in now, wasting expensive tuition..."" This is one of my complaints about online classes. I prefer living in a dorm. I also do not get where her logic comes from— saying ""it is too late to enter"" when it is not even time yet. She is both technologically illiterate and stubborn. I am the one attending college, yet she is the one getting mad. If I enter at 9:50, I am fine with it. But she acts crazy even before 9:20. And when it is GLSC, she asks, ""Do you have class?"" I say, ""No."" She replies, ""What kind of college is this if there is no class every day?"""
2543;0;As someone who has always done everything alone, I just realized that being cared for feels really nice.
2544;2;Loser!
2545;2;I am so annoyed with this one person. They are really clueless. Take the hint, you are not being included.
2546;1;Maybe I seem petty, but I just do not like seeing douchebags who live such smooth, problem-free lives. They do not deserve it.
2547;1;Sometimes we really do need affection from our parents. These days, even a small complaint gets blown out of proportion. If I feel happy about something, they criticize and belittle it. Sigh.
2548;1;I have applied to this company three days ago and still have not received any email. Can I just unapply from them?
2549;0;The exams are over. Time to study for Monday! #LetUsGoSpirit #HelloSemester4
2550;1;I am afraid that my male friends who currently have feelings for me will suddenly drift away once they find out I do not want a relationship. So we were not really friends, huh? That actually hurts.
2551;1;"Hopefully next semester, the PowerPoint slides at Binus can be improved. I hope the quality will match that of a ""world-class"" university, not like these current slides that feel like random summaries slapped together."
2552;2;Suddenly I thought, who would I invite if I get married someday? I only have four friends.
2553;2;It must be nice for those who had the chance to go on a staycation in the middle of all these final project deadlines. Do not leave behind your friends who cannot go because they are busy with assignments.
2554;2;If I got to be honest, I hate you. I hate how you take things. Yeah, I know you tried to be good. I appreciate them. But that doesn't justify the bad things you did. I couldn't say this before because I still held into my feelings. I tried to believe, just like you did. But we were never on the same page. Our views on things are different. But I tried to understand, and I believe you didn't. You only expected me to change while I tried to change. I know I should be the one to have the effort. But what is it if it is never enough? I'm tired. And now, I can finally tell that I hate you.
2555;0;Day 121 of internship. Will this lead directly to a job?
2556;1;When your dream of getting a good GPA Never comes true, well, let it be — Bondan Prakoso
2557;1;Why is that Bimay pop-up survey on the For You Page so annoying? I have been trying to upload to the forum, but it keeps refreshing because of that pop-up.
2558;1;"My parents are impressive, really. They are better at writing a five-paragraph journal in English than reading a five-paragraph message from their child pouring their heart out. Let alone reading it, most likely they would just turn it into a lecture aimed at ""improving"" their child."
2559;1;I wanted to take a photo sitting on the edge of a tall building at Binus, but it is really hard to find a spot for that.
2560;0;Are basic statistics and applied statistics the same? Are we allowed to bring a calculator and have an open book?
2561;1;Guys, I am curious. For those of you in computer science, how much was your final score in the algorithm and programming course? Did you pass or not?
2562;2;So if you have already been accepted for an internship through the Binus app, you are not allowed to reject it? I think the system is rather ridiculous. I do not see any fairness here, especially for students who realize during the interview that the job description is different from what was written. Please, do not let the system make students feel powerless like this. @binusInternship, honestly, you are ridiculous.
2563;2;"No matter how high your degree is, no matter how many certificates you have, they are useless if you cannot help other people. We should be grateful to get a bachelor's degree. At the very least, if your GPA is bad, damn it, then after graduating, help people. Your help will be more useful for society. – ""My High School Teacher"""
2564;2;I felt like I failed the midterm yesterday. There were several questions I could not finish and some I answered randomly. I calculated that I would get around 30 to 40. But when I checked, the lecturer gave me 75. I think the lecturer was just being too kind, maybe they saw how desperate or dumb I looked in my answers and felt sorry for me. Thank you, sir. I really do not want to retake the course, I am already in my fifth semester.
2565;1;It is legally allowed to abuse your abuser as a form of defense and reaction.
2566;2;How do you make friends at campus? I have always been extremely quiet, I cannot even get a single word out. From the beginning of the final year project until now, I still do not have any friends at the campus.
2567;0;Is the health declaration feature still working?
2568;1;Is there anyone who wants to hang out with me for the next week? I am on break and have nothing to do. Jakarta only.
2569;1;To the admin who I think is from B23, the one who uploads on Instagram with a different typeface, where the font looks stretched—please make it consistent with the other admins. It is easier on the eyes to read the regular typeface, and it looks a bit odd seeing something different in the Instagram feed. Thank you.
2570;1;Where can I find a boyfriend?
2571;2;I feel extremely insecure. My fellow interns are all so skilled. I really hope I can absorb some of their skills.
2572;2;How did all of you manage to graduate? I keep repeating classes every year. When do you think I will finally graduate? Someone please help me.
2573;1;My partner asked me to send a topless photo. What should I do? Why is dating like this?
2574;1;Has the schedule already been released? Why have I not received it yet?
2575;1;Run, there is a pick-me girl in Sunken Court.
2576;2;Four wins, four losses. Pushing rank at the beginning of the season really is cursed.
2577;2;Still having problems with apartment neighbors who have no sense of time. Shouting vulgar words, laughing, and speaking loudly at 11 at night—are you even sane? TC 3308 or wherever, please ask your friends to keep it down. This is not just a one or two-day thing, it happens almost every day. Do not act like you are the only one living in this entire building. I am going insane listening to you every night.
2578;2;Excuse me, I would like to ask those in Interactive Multimedia or Database Technology. What are the pros and cons of those two streams? And if someone is not very strong in coding, which stream would be better to choose? Thank you in advance.
2579;0;Please share some good Spotify podcasts. It can be motivational, horror, or anything else.
2580;0;B26 boyfriend from Management with B26 girlfriend from Chinese Literature, yes or no?

2585;2;Please fix the server.
2586;1;GSLC and assignments only gave grades in the 80s at best, midterms at most 85, and only one person got a 90. This is crazy, how are they even going to raise our grades now?
2587;1;I want to attend offline classes again.
2588;1;Hey, you all know that we can download our scores as a PDF, right? On your end, is the cumulative GPA on that PDF the same as the GPA shown on the old Bimay dashboard, or are they different?
2589;2;How do we register for internships? Can we already start now?
2590;0;Is the streaming website Ninegoal legal?
2591;1;With full onsite classes, I will end up wearing the same clothes over and over again.
2592;0;I am no longer a virgin.
2593;1;Are many Wi-Fi networks having issues today?
2594;0;My female friend ended up not staying at my place. Another female friend is willing to take her in. Thank you, God, for providing a solution. And thank you also to my friends who cared and helped me find a solution.
2595;0;Please recommend some Korean hip hop or Korean R&B songs.
2596;2;Indihome is terrible.
2597;2;I hope all of you stay safe. Do not go outside unless it is really necessary. Take care of yourselves. Please also pray that Indonesia remains peaceful and that this situation does not last long. I love you all, Bunisian [removed]3, because if [removed]3 only has two people...
2598;2;I am really unlucky to get the head of the study program as my thesis advisor, and now they have gone on vacation abroad.
2599;2;I entered Binus because I did not get accepted into a public university, and now I tried SBM again and got in. Suddenly, I feel sad about leaving Binus. There are just too many beautiful memories.
2600;1;It hurts when our feelings are rejected by a girl.
2601;1;I want to ask, for those who got the midterm for Web Programming, do we only submit the PDF? Should the project be uploaded to cloud storage like Google Drive or OneDrive?
2602;0;I want to ask, until which semester do we have final projects?
2603;2;I want to do the group assignment for AOL, but it feels like I do not have a group.
2604;1;I am not ready to start commuting between Tangerang and Jakarta tomorrow for my internship, being squeezed in the train and all that. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?
2605;1;So this is how it feels to be ignored by a best friend since elementary school.
2606;2;Someone I really care about (not in a romantic way) is addicted to debt. I am emotionally exhausted from telling her, but she never changes. She is actually very kind, but I am the only one who sees how this is traumatic. Why does she never want to change? Help, everyone, I do not know what to do anymore. I cannot just leave her because she means a lot to me.
2607;0;On the first day of onsite class, the person sitting behind me fell asleep and snored really loudly.
2608;2;Turns out it was the wrong person.
2609;2;I got sick from being exhausted working on assignments, and yet the assignments keep coming.
2610;2;It is true that as people grow older, most of them do not want to rush into a relationship. Being in a relationship requires money and quite a bit of resources. It is true that money can buy happiness. I have to earn money first.
2611;1;I feel uncomfortable in my current major. Is it complicated to transfer to another major?
2612;2;I have been waiting for Bimay to come back for what feels like forever just to submit an assignment. It is really stressful.
2613;1;Entrepreneurship... the worst subject when it comes to assignments, but it is worth learning.
2614;1;To the person in Alam Sutera whose car was blocked by an Xpander, sorry, it could not be pushed. It was already put in neutral, but I am not sure it could be moved. It still felt heavy earlier. I do not know what was wrong. I finish class at 3 o'clock.
2615;0;Usually, how are onsite final exams conducted? Are we allowed to bring a calculator or a cheatsheet? Which course is that for? Oh yes, if the exam is onsite, does the schedule appear on Bimay? Not on Exambinus?
2616;1;Am I the only one who feels that the older I get, the more I do not care to follow gossip here and there? I just want to live a peaceful life.
2617;1;Happy Halloween! The assignments are really scary, right?
2618;1;Please, if someone from the same major or class tries to approach you romantically, it is better not to continue. Because later on, things can get awkward when you see each other in class.
2620;2;Everyone, please share some diet tips and tricks. I lost weight before, but now I am stuck at 55 kilograms and it is not going down anymore.
2621;1;They keep telling their child to stay at home, but the house itself does not feel like a home.
2622;1;How many times a day is considered a high libido?
2623;2;Damn, the area around Binus Kemanggisan and Syahdan is completely jammed. I regret going to campus in the afternoon like this—it overlaps with the time when students are going home from school.
2624;1;I joined the community service hour campaign since early September and have finished it, but why has the hour still not been recorded? Does it really take this long?
2625;2;Having an EPC like this is really annoying. When students are late in submitting assignments, we get blamed for not being punctual. But come on, it is not our fault—my EPC responds really slowly, to the point where my friends are exhausted from following up with them repeatedly. Please, respect students too. We want our grades and to finish our tasks quickly, but they disappear whenever they want.
2626;2;To those of you who are saying Ahmad Maulana is a psychopath, do you really understand what a psychopath is? Maybe you are just blindly following what others post on Twitter? That kind of violence happens a lot, even in marriages. So does that mean you think every domestic violence perpetrator is a psychopath? Please do your research again. Are the terms you are using even correct?
2627;1;To the person who seems cold but actually cares, take care on your trip back to your hometown. I hope you have a safe journey and come back soon. For other Binus students who are going home too, take care as well. For those who are not, just relax in your boarding house.
2628;2;Why do Binus girls always have to go out by car and not by motorcycle? And they always go to expensive places like clubs, department stores, and so on?
2629;2;"As simple as one ""bye-bye"" from them at the end of a conversation, my entire world suddenly feels full of colors. Help, I do not want to fall in love again."
2630;0;Hey, to those from Kemanggisan who play golf, let us play together sometime.
2631;1;What do you think? I asked my boyfriend to help me buy something, which would take at most 30 minutes. But he refused, saying he had to do an assignment with his friend. Why do I feel annoyed?
2632;0;Captain on bridge.
2633;2;The lecturer was so relaxed in class, and now we are completely lost during the exam.
2634;1;Does anyone have information on an empty boarding house in Green Sedayu for next month? I prefer one located along the main road, not inside residential complexes like Allogio and others, but if there is one, that is fine too. Most of them are full already and it is hard to find one.
2635;0;Please share boarding house information around Alam Sutera.
2636;1;Is it just me, or do guys rarely send personal chats—whether it is to male or female friends?
2637;0;Never compare yourself to others. Why? Because it is unfair to them to be compared to you. You should be ashamed.
2638;1;I saw on BinusParent that every class still has a virtual class link. Does this mean Binus still gives the option to study online, but going onsite is allowed too? Please do not give me false hope, Binus.
2639;2;Oh my God, why are my friends so slow? And whenever there is something to do, they have no initiative, everything ends up being my responsibility. Then, when I give instructions, they never do it correctly, there is always some mistake that makes me feel so fed up. I am tired of always having to explain everything. I feel like I want to let out my emotions, but since they are my friends, I can only hold it in and express it little by little. Help.
2640;1;Why wait for karma to happen to someone you dislike if you can just be the karma yourself? Because sometimes, some things are simply not worth waiting for. Just a thought. If you do not agree with this sentence, that is fine.
2641;2;"I recently got to know a guy, a college friend. He was the one who initiated the introduction and started a conversation. At first, I had no idea that he liked me, I was just chatting with him casually. After a few weeks, he confessed his feelings to me, even though I already have a boyfriend. Then I told him, ""Hey, I already have a boyfriend."" He said, ""Yes, I know, I just wanted to confess. I knew you would reject me."" If you were in my position, how would you feel? I was really upset. He already knew I had a boyfriend, but he still confessed. Where was his common sense?"
2642;2;Does this still happen in this day and age in your extended family, either from your father’s or mother’s side, where you are told not to interfere in your parents’ matters? And the one saying this is not even your parent, but a relative from your father’s side. I understand that it is my father’s issue, but as his child, I want to defend my parent and explain what really happened based on facts. How could I be forbidden from doing that? My father’s extended family is clearly siding with the person who caused the problem, which is my father’s older sibling.
2643;2;If you are angry, then just be angry, but can you please not use harsh words? I feel really sad.
2644;0;May I ask if it is acceptable to use books from Google Books as references? By the way, for those who do not pay, Google Books only shows a preview of the book’s content.
2645;0;I would like to ask the guys, what is your opinion about girls who wear glasses?
2646;0;Does anyone know the answer to Beelingua B2.1 Unit 5 Activity 4?
2647;0;Let’s hang out together.
2648;2;The enrichment period is only a few months away, but I am still not over UI. Is it still possible to do an exchange program to UI? I really want to wear the yellow jacket.
2649;1;I regret taking an internship. If I had known, I would have chosen research or community service instead.
2650;1;If we want to request an exam dispensation (because of an obstacle like being sick), is it allowed to do it after the exam period has ended? Or is it required to report it before the exam ends?
2651;2;The BIMAY questionnaire is extremely annoying. Please help.
2652;1;Why are the most difficult classes scheduled in the afternoon? Does Sunib not realize our brains are already burned out?
2653;2;All of my notifications are from SunibGaming. This is crazy.
2654;0;Are there any tips for completing the final exam for Algorithm and Programming?
2655;1;Health insurance really feels like a scam. When you actually need it, it cannot be claimed.
2656;1;My Saturdays and Sundays are completely free. I wonder if there is any part-time work available on weekends. Honestly, I am a bit worried since I am entering the fourth semester. I am afraid there will be a lot of assignments and so on. But I will try working on weekends first, to help cover tuition fees.
2657;0;During the briefing, everyone was spamming the crying-laughing emoji. That was insane.
2658;1;Does Binus have any plans to build something like RISTEK UI, to support outstanding students and help organize competitions and similar activities like UI?
2659;2;It is extremely hot.
2660;1;For those who drive to campus, Aside from the Anggrek basement parking lot, where else can we park if it is full? Any alternative parking spots near the Syahdan or Anggrek campus?
2661;2;How many faces do you all have? If I count mine, I think I have more than ten.
2662;2;I have become so independent until now that I am really afraid I might become clingy if I get into a relationship. I am scared of becoming weak and vulnerable.
2663;1;The fact is, no matter how loyal you are to your campus and major, they will never care if you make one mistake or are going through something. This business school is quite amusing.
2664;1;Was it wrong of me to tell my old friends that yesterday was the first time I cuddled with someone?
2665;1;Hi Drew, how are you? It has been four days since we truly stopped chatting. If you are no longer reading my secrets about you, that means I have truly moved on from you. Have a nice day, Drew.
2666;1;Too afraid to die, yet not strong enough to live.
2667;0;So next week can be considered the last week to look for an internship, right?
2668;1;It is really hard nowadays to find a friend who is on the same wavelength to talk to, especially a guy.
2669;1;When will the final exam schedule be released? I keep overthinking about the finals because I am afraid it will be onsite. Sometimes the lecturers’ words cannot be trusted.
2670;1;Why is my life never happy?
2671;0;Can onsite exams also be scheduled on Saturdays or only on weekdays?
2672;2;I really do not get it, all this talk about saving electricity. People in my house often turn on the TV without watching it, or leave it on with the sound muted while they are on their phones for hours. I said, if you are not watching, just turn it off to save electricity. But my mom said it is actually more efficient to leave it on continuously than to turn it on and off (only turning it on when you want to watch). From what I observe, they actually watch TV for less than three hours a day. And now I get scolded for turning off the TV? Like what? Mom, you are the one paying for it, and I am just trying to help you here.
2673;0;To you who are reading this, I love you.
2674;0;The confession was successful. It is really exciting to have the anniversary on Christmas Eve!
2675;2;Does anyone else feel like even the most quiet and shy guys can still blend in more easily with their male friends compared to us girls who are not even that shy or quiet? Why is it like that? It feels unfair.
2677;2;I like him, but it turns out he already has a girlfriend. Before that, he showed signs of liking me, like giving me extra attention and starting small talks. He never told me he had a girlfriend—I found out from a friend.
2678;2;I cannot believe I fell for your trap—you were just passing by, then left, and only left me stuck in heartbreak! Congratulations, you succeeded!
2679;0;Where is the person from Binus Fess on Twitter who said they would make a Binus NT group? Why has the group not appeared yet?
2680;1;For those who have the research method course, is it true that the final exam will just be submitting the proposal we have made?
2681;0;Friends, is it still worth it to buy an iPhone 11?
2682;2;I swear, what is wrong with this professor who always babbles nonsense? How could he give misinformation about the final exam to the students, and only say 'sorry, miscommunication' one day before the submission deadline? Where have you been, sir?
2683;1;Please give me tips to stay calm while driving. Often when I am driving, even small things make me upset and trigger my emotions easily. I think this is not something good to hold onto, because not only does it endanger myself, it is also dangerous for other drivers. So I decided to stop doing it, but even after my best efforts to stay calm, I still get easily emotional while driving. Maybe some of you have tips I have not tried yet. I will gladly try them. Thank you in advance.
2684;0;If you order GrabFood and the driver asks for parking money, how much do you usually give?
2685;2;If I got 65 on the midterm and 49 on the lab quiz, is there still hope to get a B in the final grade? The remaining scores are for the lab project and final exam.
2686;2;I am a bit annoyed with the professor who always goes overtime and then asks 'Do you have another class after this?' and someone answers 'No' LIKE PLEASE I WANT TO SLEEP.
2687;2;I did not apply for an internship at a certain company but suddenly got called for an interview. They called me out of nowhere without any prior notice through chat or email. I panicked and agreed to the interview on a certain date. After I checked the company, I found out the reviews were bad and they did not even have their own website. During the interview, the interviewer was completely unprofessional. He kept shaking his head, did not look at the screen, and only half of his head was visible. The questions were just generic ones from Google and he barely smiled. So I ended up not answering the questions in detail because I was honestly really annoyed. For the first time, I genuinely hoped I would not get accepted for the internship at this company, and thankfully I was rejected. I was so worried I might actually get accepted.
2688;1;After discussing the assignment, he went back to ignoring me again.
2689;1;Please give me an example of a subtle message so the guy knows I have feelings for him.
2690;1;We have been laughing and joking these past few days, then suddenly the final exam schedule is out on Bimob.
2691;2;Seriously, trust no one, not even the ones you think will keep your secret. Knowing too many people just creates more problems. But honestly, only my campus circle is like this. My circle outside of campus is not like this at all... What is going on with the Sunib students?
2692;2;Hello everyone, I used to be a teaching assistant, and I would like to share a little about how grading works. In SLC, there are several divisions. First, you should know how teaching assistants grade your exams. The person grading your answers is not your own assistant. The grading is randomized, but it is still done by instructors of the same subject. For example, if the course is Web Programming: BA01’s assistant is XX00-0. BB01’s assistant is ZZ01-0. Then XX00-0 will grade BB01’s exam. All of this is randomized by the Academic division. The assistant’s grading is purely objective. After checking the answers, they are verified again by the Subject Coordinator. So, assistants do not arbitrarily give grades. The grading process goes through two layers. What about cheating? Assistants also cannot immediately accuse someone of cheating. They have to compare everything first. If something is suspicious, they report it to the Subject Coordinator. If the Subject Coordinator agrees, then it goes to Subject Development. If Subject Development confirms that it is cheating, only then can it be labeled as such. So, the cheating accusation must pass through three layers. What if you are accused of cheating? Please report it to Bimay. You will get a response. Back when I was a teaching assistant, the Subject Coordinators were actively responding to complaints as well. Do not be upset if it takes a while to get a response because there are many complaints. If you still do not believe it, feel free to join the next NAR session. Thank you, everyone.
2693;1;I need someone to talk to about my relationship. Please help.
2694;0;Do you stir your porridge or not? Cereal first or milk first?
2695;1;When I was checking my closet, I found the dress I wore for a high school fashion show. It reminded me of how I had done my makeup, was all ready, and right before I got on stage, I suddenly needed to poop. That was a truly ridiculous moment.
2696;1;All my classmates are a burden. They keep asking about assignments but never return the favor. Do they think I am a customer service bot?
2697;2;I am a student from Kemanggisan. Yesterday I tried sneaking into a class in Alam Sutera, and I just realized the girls there are really attractive—and there were about 40 of them in one class. Please balance out the population, Kemanggisan.
2698;2;Fear of College / College Trauma
2699;2;Do you want to focus on your studies or on student organizations? If you want to focus on organizations, you might as well drop out and join a political party. Just do not be a burden, seriously.
2701;1;Happy internship to all class of B24, and of course, to myself as well.
2702;1;For the GAT major, how many classes are held on-site in a week? I kindly ask for an answer from my fellow students.
2703;2;Gosh, using a proxy test-taker is such a tempting sin.
2704;0;Is there no one from the Business Creation program who wants to connect?
2705;0;In which semester does the minor program start, everyone?
2706;1;I miss being intimate with my boyfriend. He used to be the one who initiated things the fastest, but now he says he no longer feels anything. It is not because he does not love me anymore. It is just that sometimes I want to, but he does not want to anymore.
2707;2;It is time for me to overthink.
2708;1;Why can dating apps not filter by race?
2709;0;Vaccine!? https://bit.ly/VaksindiBinus Source: Bimay/Bimol/Lecturer
2710;0;I received the midterm questions for Algorithm and Programming from ****b.
2711;2;"Part 3 (finale). I woke up around 17:20. My laptop was still on, and my vision was still blurry so I had to move closer. Once things became clear, I saw my screen was still on the Binus exam page, and the ""submit"" button was still visible in bright blue. My head immediately heated up. Damn, I almost missed it just because I nearly fell asleep. The end."
2712;2;I am growing tired, slowly slipping away from my reality and beginning to have thoughts that everyone is changing as time passes, and I am the one to blame.
2713;1;I think my Valorant skills were better when I first started playing than they are now...
2714;2;Is there anyone else who has gone through one semester of college and still does not understand anything?
2715;0;If anyone has the Discord link for Beelingua B25, please share it.
2716;2;It is only one day left, but not a single company has given any confirmation.
2717;1;If we have already been accepted for an internship at a company through the internship app, can we reject it?
2718;0;My dearest waifu, you are very beautiful. I love you.
2719;2;I was about to sleep when I suddenly remembered the accounting deadline.
2720;0;Are the Binus library and Beehub open today?
2721;1;Damn, right before the final exams, I got addicted to Netflix.
2722;2;I have already given up on the midterm exams, as long as the answers are not completely blank.
2723;0;For those who have ever repeated a course by joining a short semester, was the subject easier during the short semester or during the regular semester? What are the differences?
2724;1;You were too blinded by what you wanted that it ended up breaking you, and you did not even realize you lost someone who always supported you even after you hurt them. Now you are sad all by yourself, right? Even if I wanted to support you, I cannot do anything anymore because you cut me off.
2725;1;I am confused with Binus for constantly campaigning and making programs that encourage being eco-friendly, when they do not even provide water dispensers so people can refill their tumblers. Instead, they sell bottled water for six thousand rupiahs. That is truly greenwashing like a corporation, not like an educational institution.
2726;0;I want to ask, for those who applied and got accepted into the independent study program at Kampus Merdeka, how long did the selection process take and was there a test?
2727;2;There are already many exam questions with long answers, some require handwritten responses, and others ask us to record a video explaining the answer. There are still weekly assignments, presentations, more quizzes, and all the deadlines are very tight and appear suddenly like round tofu. Truly human behavior.
2728;0;Guys, I am from batch 2024 and I want to register for the short semester. How do I do that?
2729;1;When it rains, it feels like the first semester again, struggling with the SOCS online judge. Luckily, it is gone now.
2730;1;Joining the PKKM program is actually quite nice. You get an allowance, only have to attend twice a week, and for the final report you just copy and paste the materials from the slides and you are done.
2731;0;Does Sunibcurhat have advertisements now?
2732;1;How do I avoid getting nervous and awkward in front of my crush?
2733;2;Cheating actually feels good, does it not?
2734;0;Guys, when is BIFEST?
2735;0;Does anyone know where to rent a Dyson Airwrap?
2736;1;I want to ask, if someone forgets to submit their midterm and, hopefully not, gets a score below the passing grade, can they just take the short semester or do they have to retake the full semester?
2737;1;The less you interfere with other people’s lives, the more peaceful your life becomes.
2738;2;Is it not frustrating when a lecturer speaks extremely softly during class?
2739;2;Having my period is really troublesome. My lower back usually hurts before it starts, and it would be better if it only took a few days, but it has not come for a week now. I hope it comes soon so I can finally sleep peacefully.
2740;0;I will just spend New Year’s Eve at home, because if I leave, I am afraid that when I return, my house will have turned into a Mixue outlet.
2741;2;I wanted to register for the JLPT, but the website has been crashing with no explanation since yesterday. Is there anyone else experiencing the same thing here? For those who do not know, JLPT is like the TOEFL but for the Japanese language.
2742;1;"I am really scared to do an internship under the name of my university. People will expect me to be ""great,"" but honestly, my skills are just average."
2743;2;To be honest, I am really frustrated being single. I want to have a partner. The pandemic is not even over yet, so how can I meet anyone?
2744;1;Mocha, what is wrong with you?
2745;2;Remember, if your relationship is going through a rough patch, do not try to seek relief by talking to someone else. Do not look for comfort in someone else. It will really hurt the person you are with.
2746;0;Does anyone understand what an elective course means? There was a briefing earlier but I fell asleep.
2747;2;I really am stupid, right? I tried to open my heart for you. Now I am being called overly emotional. You were the one who said you opened your heart for me before. Haha, what a lie.
2748;2;Damn, that video of people kissing on the Alsut rooftop is so disgusting. They really have no brains!
2749;1;Why can I not log into the TFI app since yesterday? The registration period is ending soon too.
2750;0;Can anyone recommend skincare products for oily skin?
2751;1;Hello, is there anyone here who can teach or help fix the page numbers on my thesis?
2752;2;Another level of nonsense is organizational progress meetings. Every time I join one, only about 10% is about actual progress, while 30% is toxic conversations and off-topic talk among the committee members.
2753;1;Who was the person who invited me to the gym yesterday? Where are you now, gym buddy? I want to stay consistent.
2754;2;So you still want me to pay that much for tuition fees? Even after spending months feeling like an unemployed person at home... (Seriously, please increase the discount, income is really limited right now.)
2755;2;Wow, the midterm exam is seriously so difficult.
2756;2;Lately, I have been waking up in the middle of the night, screaming and crying. Only at dawn can I finally fall asleep. Yay, all thanks to university life.
2757;0;Does anyone have the video of the people who got caught kissing at Binus Alsut?
2758;2;I am really annoyed that at home I am always the one asked to do all the chores just because I am a girl. Meanwhile, my younger brother gets to relax comfortably in his room. So only girls are supposed to do housework, and boys are not? What do you all think about this?
2759;1;What would happen if, God forbid, I do not get an internship by the end of January?
2760;0;Guys, when you go out with your partner, how much money do you usually bring or spend?
2761;1;I am going to campus tomorrow, but I am really scared to drive to the Anggrek building. The last time I went there, I crashed into the parking wall while going down. (Yes, it was my fault, I turned too far to the left)
2762;2;"I have lived for 19 years and this is the first time I have met someone like this in college. He really acts like he is the only rich person around. At first, I felt neutral, but eventually, I got extremely annoyed. He keeps talking about other people’s wealth and always says people are jealous of his life. I mean, have you never seen someone who has more than you? And one thing that really annoyed me was when he said that people who rarely hang out are not rich, and he claimed that others would be jealous when they see his stories. Honestly, I was irritated but also trying hard not to laugh. I really wanted to respond, because hanging out only costs a little, right? And sometimes people do not want to hang out every day not because they ""have no money"", but simply because there is no reason to do it every day. That just makes you look very afraid of missing out. Anyway, get well soon."
2763;2;I feel envious of my friends who have already completed their thesis defense before me.
2764;2;“You have plenty of time, do not wait until the deadline because the server might be down.” Yes, but the university has had months to improve the server and still has done nothing.
2765;2;Treated kindly but becomes arrogant, joked around and suddenly becomes judgmental. What a ridiculous person.
2766;2;Damn it, Alam Sutera became congested again because all of you are onsite. What a mess.
2767;0;For those who have experience, is the onsite final exam as difficult as the online one?
2768;1;Hey guys, I have been in college for three semesters and I still do not understand what the semester payment is called. Is it BP3 or something else? I do not understand, and whenever I am asked how much the semester fee is, I cannot answer. Please help me out.
2769;1;How do you stop feeling panicked? Because once I panic, it can last for an entire day or even longer.
2770;1;I think it is true that the “pembelasunib” account is that person's new account.
2771;0;Please give me shoe recommendations for walking and jogging.
2772;1;Whose New Bimay is taking a really long time?
2773;0;I do not want to argue, I just want to make new friends.
2774;2;I thought online learning would be more efficient because it does not waste money, fuel, and you can do it from anywhere and anytime. But it turns out it has a downside, which is students cannot clearly understand the material. I do not know, but around 90% complain about not being able to understand what they are learning even after two or three hours. So, whether it is three subjects, two subjects, two hours, four hours, six hours—it does not really matter. They will still struggle to understand unless they are in a quiet and comfortable place to study.
2775;2;For this final exam, I have to carry two groups. Thank you so much, July will be even more delightful. There is even a deadline for Monday, and only one product is finished... the other one is not. This is really frustrating.
2776;1;Guys, has anyone ever asked the lecturer to make a group final project into an individual one? Do you think that would be allowed?
2777;1;If I want to change my streaming class, is it still possible?
2778;0;What should I do to feel refreshed when I am sleepy, guys?
2779;0;The exam is coming soon. How is your preparation going?
2780;1;What does it mean when all the final exams are onsite?
2781;1;Have you ever liked a classmate? What should I do? Please share your stories. I am afraid I will not be in the same class as him anymore.
2782;1;Where can I see my academic transcript?
2783;0;Is there anyone who wants to go around Jakarta with me tomorrow? If you are interested, just send me a direct message on Line: jzkv
2784;1;Love with different religions is really heavy.
2785;0;BMW = Car Brand no, BMW = To Attract Women yes Sorry, it is a silly and pointless joke.
2786;2;Can someone give me food recommendations? I am confused about what to eat. I get so confused that I end up eating the same food for a whole week, from lunch to dinner, because I do not want to think about what to eat. In the end, I get sick of it.
2787;1;Is it normal for couples to kiss on the lips while dating?
2788;2;I have a crush and I want to get closer to him. But when I tried to talk to him, he ended up talking to another girl instead, and it was not even about anything important—just small talk. I felt really sad and cried when I got home. I want to know whether he actually does not like me or what. If you were me, how would you feel?
2789;1;The structured data quiz is very unclear, here is Lesti’s response.
2792;0;During midterm exams, are we still allowed to come to campus? I want to use the learning center or maybe go to the canteen.
2793;1;Excuse me, for those in batch 23, 22, or above 24, is there anyone who has taken an internship related to IT support? If yes, can you please share what the tasks are? Thank you.
2794;0;On Saturday nights, do you study or just relax and forget about your courses?
2795;1;I do not really understand Business Analysis final exam. Can someone please tutor me?
2796;1;If anyone knows of an online seminar, please share it. I still need one more point.
2797;1;If the thesis is not ready within one semester, will I be able to change my thesis advisor in the next semester? Or will I have to continue with the same one until I finish?
2798;2;Gwsukamakan/Sunibgaming or whatever your name is, I saw that you replied to everything, so why did you not respond to the Male 18 post about boarding houses? Could it be that…
2799;1;Why do I feel so tired?
2800;0;As a citizen of Indonesia, I am quite proud of our cultural diversity. But there are always people who say that one of our national cultures is laziness. That made me think: if someone is lazy, does that make them a cultural figure?
2801;0;"I want to be a game booster so I can earn extra pocket money... Meanwhile in another universe Game booster: ""I am tired and want to quit boosting"""
2802;1;Actually, when we enter the campus, do we have to show that we have done the campus check-in and filled out the health declaration form to the security guard, or can we just go in?
2803;1;Why do I feel lonely even though I am hanging out with people?
2804;1;I am drinking wine, because you will never be mine.
2805;1;When you make plans with your friends, do you usually arrive on time? For example, if you agree to meet online at 10:00, do you show up around 9:55 or 9:57, or are you slightly late like 10:01 or 10:04?
2806;1;Hello, is there anyone currently looking for an online assistant like an online shop admin? If there is, may I apply? I would like to help my parents earn money as well. Thank you.
2807;1;Lecturer, please, if you assign a group final project, kindly still allow students who prefer to work individually to do so. The reality is, there are students who actually prefer working alone.
2808;1;I need one more female PUBG player to join the PINC Ladies tournament.
2809;2;My groupmate is absolutely terrible. They copied content from a website and did not change anything at all. It really made me angry.
2810;1;I want to learn Python. Where should I start? I am an accounting student.
2811;0;Many people suggest parking at the Alsut mall. Is the parking fee not expensive there?
2812;0;For the boys, I am curious about your preferences in girls. Personally, I like petite, fair-skinned, and smart girls.
2813;2;This class representative drama is really cringe. If you want information that is fast and clear, just ask the lecturer directly. The information is usually shared during the first meeting. There is no need to act helpless by depending on the class representative and demanding them to fulfill their role, especially when their presence is unclear. Just because they are inactive does not mean the entire class becomes clueless. If the lecturer replies with “I already told the class representative, ask them,” then be honest and say the class representative cannot be contacted. The lecturer will understand. If this is how you handle things in college, you might as well go back to school and learn how to politely and properly ask your teacher.
2814;1;After the midterm grades were released, it became very clear that my classmates were less serious when responding to forum questions in courses where the class average was low, and more serious in courses where the class average was above 85.
2815;2;Hey, I am late in registering for the pre-thesis. What should I do? I did not understand how to enroll yesterday on the BCS website. I had a Zoom call with SSC but they only told me to submit a form. This is frustrating.
2816;0;Thank you admin, finally my notifications are no longer piling up. Love you.
2817;2;I am sorry, Mom. I blocked your WhatsApp. You talk too much without considering my current situation.
2818;0;How do I register for the Beehub gym? Do I just go there directly?
2819;1;For the guys, why does my hair always fall flat shortly after I apply gel or clay? I see my friends’ hair staying in place for hours.
2820;2;I am very traumatized by judgmental looks after speaking or performing in front of a large audience.
2821;0;Who is the donor behind the domain and web hosting of SunibCurhat? That is really cool.
2822;2;This is crazy. I am so stressed having an event leader who keeps disappearing. I need their opinion and confirmation, but they cannot be reached. They are not responding to messages at all. This is exhausting.
2823;1;I have never spoken to this guy, I do not even remember his name and I do not think we have ever introduced ourselves, but we are in the same class. He greeted me and I got confused because no one else greets me like that except my friends. Is this person just very friendly or actually weird?
2824;1;Good evening. I would like to ask, for next semester’s enrichment program, I chose the certified internship option and I have already been accepted. When I opened BiMay -> Enrichment, it asked me to fill in the Supervisor form. What does that mean? And for the schedule, should I ask the contact number of the Supervisor listed on the form or the company’s Human Resources? Thank you.
2825;1;Recently I have had a crush on a celebrity. I feel like I want to be their partner, but I also feel like I am just a speck of dust, a lonely person with no life.
2826;1;You are like a DOG.................................cute
2827;2;Vent // Every time there are midterms or finals, I always feel like giving up. I feel overwhelmed with all the assignments that appear every day, and I do not even know how to do them. The one-week deadline seems like it should be enough, but instead it feels really stressful because I still cannot finish the tasks for each subject.
2828;2;Tired of this one person who kept asking questions during the final exam and in the end wanted to see my answers. Now that person just disappeared, how annoying. Initial I____ (same major)
2829;0;Guys, can you recommend a good short hairstyle for men?
2830;1;If only finding a soulmate was as easy as finding Mixue.
2831;1;Is there a senior here who works or is seeking a job in the product field (product management)? May I ask for some tips regarding CVs or portfolios? Thank you.
2832;1;What are the signs that a friend is starting to avoid us?
2833;1;I would like to ask something about hospitality. Sometimes there are rooms where smoking is allowed, but vaping is not. Why is that?
2834;2;Kevin from class B25, you are like a dog.
2835;0;When you go to Slipi, I become sleepy.
2836;2;My last relationship was four years ago, and it ended because it was toxic. I was really traumatized, and now a really kind guy is approaching me and treating me like a queen, but I do not feel anything. Is there something wrong with me?
2837;1;Sometimes I hope Sunib would create a student-friendly policy for the 3+1 Study Abroad program, for example, if a student has a GPA above 3.5, half of the cost is covered, so those who perform well but are less fortunate financially can still join... just a thought.
2838;1;Guys, what does it mean when a guy remembers small things about us? Like when I am chatting with a guy, he often says things like 'you usually go online at 1 p.m. on Saturdays' or 'you joined on the xth date of x month,' I am so confused.
2839;1;What else am I lacking? I am already not handsome, and I am also not rich.
2840;2;Where is a good place to sleep at Binus? Honestly, I am so sleepy. I stayed up all night working on a paper and have not slept at all. Now I am on campus.
2841;2;There are 14 people in my batch, and only the two of us in the same group have not defended our thesis yet. I kind of regret not rushing the thesis and having it delayed for 3.5 years. It is not that I was not ambitious, I just kept thinking about how expensive tuition is and felt bad for my parents. But I can still graduate on time! Please wish me luck.
2842;1;Still fighting.
2843;1;"Is it considered normal if a company asks about ""ethnicity"" in the application form? What is the relevance? It is insane if I have to intern there."
2844;1;Are the midterm and final exams this semester going to be online or offline?
2845;1;"I am a bit confused about the language. I am from Sumatra and planning to move to Bandung. In Sumatra, I usually speak using ""aku"" and ""kau."" What is the best way to speak in Bandung? Because using ""kau"" can sound rude. Is it better to just use ""aku"" and ""kamu""? For seniors from Binus in Bandung, how do you usually speak with your friends? Is it strange to replace ""aku"" with your own name? For example, ""Rahel wants to go to SB, do you want to come?"" Please give me suggestions on how to communicate better and more comfortably. I also want suggestions from class of 2026 in Bandung. What would be the best way?"
2846;1;What is the benefit of going to campus if everything can be done online?
2847;1;Tomorrow something will be empty. Not the heart, but the answer sheet.
2848;0;Do you know the word “menu”? Yes, it is me and you.

2850;1;Is there anyone still looking for an internship? Or anyone who wants to do an internship to fill their free time?
2851;1;I want to earn some income so I will not feel bored.
2852;1;I have graduated and already started working, but my mind still gets stressed easily.
2853;2;I do not know why, but no matter how difficult something is, as long as it generates money, I stay motivated. But when it is difficult and still requires me to spend money, I become very lazy. A good example is college.
2854;1;Jesus, please help me with the midterm exams.
2855;1;Tomorrow my internship starts, and I have already experienced how crowded public transportation is during rush hours. It is crowded even outside of rush hours, let alone during. I wish we could pay a bit more to get more comfort in public transport. I do not want to use a private vehicle because it would only increase traffic.
2856;0;I am proud of myself for reaching the level where I can feel happy and joyful when others get something new. I used to feel jealous in the past.
2857;1;Is there really no one who wants to hang out with me?
2858;0;Even though we are no longer together, it does not mean I am not allowed to see you happy. Keep up the spirit with your studies.
2859;1;I feel extremely unmotivated to do my midterm exams.
2860;1;Why is the world often unfair?
2861;1;To you with the initials DMH, I still love and care about you no matter what, even though you have distanced yourself and closed your heart. I hope you will be happy.
2862;1;I already had a feeling that this “sunibgaming” person is truly strange. He has caused SO many problems and trouble. I used to hope he would change. Come on, he is already in college, he should be more mature, not still acting like a high school kid.
2863;0;Has anyone watched My School President?
2864;1;For those in Computer Science, has anyone received the SOCS questions after the midterms?
2865;1;I usually do not like to be extreme, but anyone who believes in astrology is a red flag.
2866;0;Brothers and sisters, has anyone been accepted into the Independent Study program at Visual Dart? I have been accepted, and I want to find friends so we can share knowledge later on.
2867;1;It feels really sad to see a score of 89.
2868;1;Is there anyone pursuing a career in Human Resources? I would like to ask about the salary and career progression in the future. Is an HR position considered promising? I am still unsure whether I should pursue being an academic (lecturer) or go into HR.
2869;1;I just broke up.
2870;1;Can anyone explain how to take the Binus shuttle bus from Anggrek campus to Alam Sutera?
2871;0;Are there many first-semester students from SoCS who got remedial grades in Algorithm and Programming this time?
2872;1;Girls from B26, please be careful with a guy from B25 with the initials BB, from the Game Application and Technology major. If he messages you through Instagram, do not respond, just ignore or block him if possible. My girlfriend has been a victim of verbal harassment because of him, and there are already several other girls from B26 who have been victims too (not just my girlfriend).
2873;2;Everything feels so cringey now. I really miss the old SunCoop.
2874;2;They say high school friends are supposed to be closer and more open than friends you meet in university. But in reality, even my high school friend who went to university with me still stabbed me in the back.
2875;1;In elite classes, midterms are difficult.
2876;0;Is sex important in a relationship?
2877;1;We are in the middle of midterms, and suddenly the batch group chat is in chaos because of the messy specialization choices. Oh my God, Sunib, please stop stressing the students out.
2878;1;Has anyone ever experienced having COVID?
2879;1;The cases of people making out keep increasing, huh? Everyone at Sunib seems overly passionate.
2880;1;I used to be fine being alone. Then during the relationship, I was almost never alone (at least we would chat). Now that we broke up, being alone feels unfamiliar.
2881;1;For those asking when the final exam scores will be out, it will probably be on Friday. The finals ended on the 9th, so two weeks after that would be this coming Friday.
2882;1;Please do not be strict if you become parents.
2883;2;"I laughed when a girl was being disrespectful. Even you, as my boyfriend, when I gave you advice, you replied with ""do not interfere."" That is ridiculous, you are unbelievable."
2884;1;Guys, is it considered gay to give your close male friend a good night kiss on the forehead?
2885;1;Men are visual beings, they need data visualization.
2886;2;Dear *sjp, you are so pathetic.
2887;0;What student clubs did you all join? Please share the pros and cons.
2888;2;Wait... I did not receive my Flazz card with my university jacket? I only got the jacket, but not the Flazz card?
2889;0;Wow, more drama. Would anyone like some tea? I also have popcorn. Let us watch this random drama together.
2890;2;COVID cases are increasing again. Will the final exams be held online?
2891;0;What are your thoughts or reactions, girls, if you find out that your boyfriend is watching TikTok or Instagram videos of sexy women?
2892;2;I miss the campus chicken... I mean Rocky's chicken.
2893;0;Does anyone have information on a trusted Japan-Indonesia personal shopping service?
2894;1;Is it true that the start date for the next semester has been moved up to February 13?
2895;1;I hope you are happy with her... this is for the Accounting student from B22.
2896;0;How are you doing?
2897;2;Excuse me, does Sunib not know that many of its students work on assignments in the middle of the night?
2898;2;I need someone who can fill the emptiness in my heart. It is a bit cringey, but I hope that is fine.
2899;2;Oh my, I feel extremely lazy.
2900;1;Why does the new class still feel like it is made up of half the people from the previous class? Is it usually like that?
2901;1;It is better not to avoid the courses you dislike. If you fail, you will have to face that subject again later, like me now — and it is really unpleasant.
2902;2;The stupidity is beyond saving. Absolutely ridiculous.
2903;0;I just want to say that I loved you first since we first met. And I fell for you even harder.
2904;1;Is there anyone from SOCS here who has practice questions for Algorithm and Programming? If anyone has them, please share.
2905;0;Thank you @Dksrs for the introduction.
2906;2;He got close to me but ended up in a relationship with someone else. How unbelievable. What a sharp turn. Whatever.
2907;2;I just watched a TikTok where a guy was begging his girlfriend, and it made me so angry and cringe so hard. I really cannot stand guys like that.
2908;2;Hey, did you all get a pop-up for GPA evaluation below 2.00? They said you can check it in your inbox under the title 'even semester academic performance evaluation', but I did not get anything in my inbox. Also, the midterm results are not even out yet, and my last GPA was above 3. I am so scared.
2909;2;Just go, someone will talk to you even if you are alone, they said. I was lied to. I went there alone and ended up not knowing what to do. Damn it.
2910;2;I filled in the health declaration saying I was sick because that was the truth, but my lecturer said, 'If you are supposed to be onsite but attend online, I will not mark your attendance.' And he really meant it. Alright then, sir, if I get sick and have COVID next time, I will just come to your class anyway so I do not get marked absent. You keep changing the schedule however you want, and it is the students who are burdened. Where is your professionalism as a lecturer?
2911;2;Damn, I forgot to do the entrepreneurship assignment.
2912;1;Yesterday was just the internship introduction, and the person on my right asked me, 'Which major are you from?' I answered, accounting. Then I also asked the same question to the person on my left, 'Which major are you from?' He answered normally. But once the presentation started, I found out that he was actually my superior. He was wearing a white shirt and dress shoes, and I thought he was also an intern. My first impression in front of my superior was completely ruined.
2913;0;I just want to let you all know that Sunib Alsut is safe. Classes are still ongoing, so please do not skip. I feel bad for my friends in the class committee who are well-behaved.
2914;0;Even though the sky that night Was bathed in starlight And the moon was shining so beautifully It only deepened the sorrow I will leave you To follow the path of my life Do not worry and do not doubt Just give me a smile Goodbye, my love Until we meet again
2915;0;If only your eyes could see me, everything in my heart would be revealed—my conscious mind, my dreams, all are yours. If only you knew, if only you knew, the secret of my love.
2916;1;I would like to ask, when does the Binus shuttle from Binus Kemanggisan to Binus Alam Sutera operate and at what times? Or maybe, where can I see the schedule for the Binus shuttle?
2917;2;Back then, when I sent a message in the group, no one even replied. But now that the deadline is near, they are suddenly active in the group and even sending private messages. How annoying.
2918;0;All of you speak arrogantly as if you are the most perfect ones.
2919;0;For those who attend onsite classes in Alam Sutera, please give a review of the parking lot. Is it crowded? Do you think there is still space to park motorcycles?
2920;2;I am from B22 and I feel like crying when I see my friends already getting jobs, while I have not even been noticed by HR at all.
2921;2;My head hurts so much, it feels like I am going to die.
2922;0;Daydreaming about how it would be if I had a boyfriend or girlfriend.
2923;0;I really want to have a Mercedes so that I can be seen as someone respectable.
2924;1;A note for you A.D.A.R.: I hope you realize that you have lost someone who truly cared and loved you… someone who tried to change and be better for you. Maybe it is easy for you to find a new guy… but I can assure you, no one will ever be as sincere as I was. I wish you all the best.
2925;1;While playing Mobile Legends, is this a sign that I am being told to start working on my midterm exam?
2926;2;When we sincerely try to be a good listener and someone who comforts them, but that person is inconsiderate and treats us like a temporary escape or emotional dumping ground... What a joke, do not bother coming if that is how you are going to be!!!
2927;0;For those taking the UTBK exam, keep up the spirit.
2928;2;My 22nd birthday is coming soon, but I have just received bad news that I might not be able to proceed with my thesis. I have decided to end my life soon, failure has always haunted me. Thank you for living for 22 years, my dear self.
2929;2;How do you control your emotions? I am struggling so much to manage mine, sometimes they explode suddenly when triggered.
2930;1;Is DHD having issues in BIMOB and BIMAY?
2931;1;Hello, does anyone know when the final exam scores will be released?
2932;1;How do I deal with a younger sibling who is addicted to their phone? I am so tired of it.
2933;1;Has anyone ever experienced Zoom not producing any sound when using earphones? Is there a solution?
2934;0;Why do I get emotional when I see other people flirting?
2935;1;Guys, where do you usually study SQL practice questions?
2936;2;I used to be someone who did not care much about myself and dressed simply as long as I looked clean and neat, but suddenly I have become feminine, and I do not understand why. Now I dress nicely even before going to sleep, I enjoy tidying up the entire house, I want to learn how to cook, and suddenly I want to open a small bakery while writing literary novels after I graduate. It is funny, because I used to be quite ambitious, wanting to become this and that, joining all sorts of events, and not caring much about my appearance. But now I care about how dull my face will look if I do not get enough sleep. It feels like my feminine side has awakened. I used to feel so independent, and now I feel the need for someone to listen to all my random stories and to accompany me to the places I like. Does anyone know what might be causing this?
2937;0;Until what time is the OTP usually valid?
2938;1;Lecturers at Binus, please add the option to choose between group work or individual work. That is all, thank you.
2939;0;Good luck to everyone taking the final exam today!
2940;2;Why does every girl I try to get close to already have a boyfriend… Even when I check their social media, there is no sign that they are in a relationship or anything.
2941;1;Why has the schedule not changed yet?
2942;2;When will I finally have a partner?
2943;2;It is quite difficult to find an internship since early November 2022 when you have disabilities. I once thought about giving up.. But my heart says I have to keep fighting until I get it. If we never try, how will we know.
2944;0;Let us go on a date with me.
2945;2;My junior high school best friend, I introduced them to my high school best friend… the three of us met in college because we are all from Binus. Now they are friends and I am left out.
2946;2;Guys, my breath feels hot, my throat feels hot, and my eyes keep stinging. Then my sister’s office is on lockdown and they are not allowed to go out for lunch. Did I get COVID?
2947;2;For introverts who are in a relationship, what do you usually do? I have never been in a relationship and I am afraid the girl would not feel comfortable because I have a hard time coming up with topics to talk about (in other words, I am not fun to talk to).
2948;1;Relax, hang out, and drop out. Hahaha.
2949;1;Already went all in with 20 million on France, if I lose I will not pay my tuition.
2950;0;Why is my girlfriend unattractive, I feel really sad, let us go find a smoking hot, sexy girl who wears revealing clothes!
2951;1;Today I officially turn 20.. I am confused whether I should feel happy or sad.
2952;1;So many times I wanted to give up, but well, here I am.
2953;1;It is normal for questions about assignments in the group chat to go unanswered, but has anyone ever experienced asking “Who is in group 7? Share the group link here” and no one answers for weeks?
2954;2;After being obsessed with the volunteer guy, it turns out we are now getting closer even though we only talk a lot when we meet (his love language is acts of service and physical touch but he is kind of cold), and he mostly just replies to my stories but still aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
2955;1;I really do not understand why there are so many assignments like this right before the holidays.
2956;1;Please teach me how to be mature, not just older in age.
2957;1;I do not want to expect anything anymore, I just had an interview, but it reminded me of a previous one where I felt confident I would be accepted, but it turned out I was not.
2958;0;Happy Sunday everyone, have a great weekend.
2959;2;Hello to the seniors, I am from B24 and I personally want to apologize on behalf of my batch for everything. But please, do not get angry so quickly, and I am truly sorry if B24 also reacted emotionally. Let us make peace, okay? Fire meeting fire will not resolve anything. Our batch's image is now stained even though it is not entirely our fault for getting the SAT information earlier. Please do not accuse us of only chasing SAT points. The seminar was open to the public, and not everyone joined it just for SAT. I personally have joined several seminars because I was genuinely interested in the topics. In my opinion, SAT is just a bonus. To everyone else, please do not stir things up and do not get angry easily. We are all at fault. We are ambitious but it does not mean we do not respect our seniors, and we truly did not know that certain seminars were mandatory for other Binus students… we sincerely apologize… thank you.
2961;1;I want to ask, is the back-to-campus welcoming party in September or August mandatory? What kind of assignments are usually given?
2962;0;I just want some money and sex.
2963;1;“It is useless to be pretty if you never step into the kitchen,” my crush said that and I cannot cook.
2964;0;Guys, about the database, since it is dummy data, does that mean we just enter it randomly from the table we created?
2965;2;I am really grateful that I can still read code.
2966;2;I want to reach out to someone because they came to mind, but I am afraid. Afraid of falling into the same spiral like before, but I still want to know how they are doing. Sigh.
2967;2;So I'm in this group full of smart and passionate people, but from time to time I feel like I feel like I'm the slowest in the group, I feel like I'm left behind, and I feel like im just a dead weight to them. In study calls I would just stay quiet because I dont even know what they're talking about, Im really trying my hardest so I can be just like them but when I finally understand something they already understand something that I don't even know they're alway two steps ahead of me. I feel like I should leave this group...
2968;2;Now, downloading HD YouTube videos requires premium. Without premium, it is stuck at 360p. This is so annoying.
2969;0;We used to chat regularly. Why did you stop chatting with me since yesterday? I miss seeing you typing.
2970;1;Waiting for you takes a very long time, but I still keep waiting. I am aware that I am not a priority.
2971;1;I am seriously asking, are homebody guys attractive in the eyes of girls?
2972;0;Joining student organizations in the fifth semester, yay or nay?
2973;1;And is it true that there is a maximum of two DHDs now?
2974;0;Classes start again tomorrow, and I feel like marking my attendance red because I am not in the mood for onsite classes.
2975;1;If you want to leave, just go. But all your devices are still logged into my account.
2976;1;Feeling really down after breaking up with my partner.
2977;1;That is a good opinion, now please go back to being..........
2978;1;Who from B25 has DHD tomorrow? I really do not feel like attending.
2979;0;to the girl who saw me tapping in room 301 during the overlapping class last Saturday at 11 a.m., let us meet soon.
2980;1;In my opinion, it is better to give clarity rather than leaving me in this uncertainty. There is no confirmation whether I got accepted or not.
2981;1;Who here cannot comfort others when they open up? Me!!
2982;2;On the 18th, the number of my friends will double. Even those who never talk to me will suddenly act really nice, asking for answers without hesitation, and not even saying thank you. Truly seasonal friends who show up every two or three months.
2983;1;In college, I am just a student without friends, trying to understand every subject on my own while handling all the difficulties and struggles by myself, without any circle. Outside of college, I can grow much more. I can be myself and freely express who I am, even having quite a few acquaintances. Outside, I feel more alive and like my life has meaning and purpose. But will that always last, even if I fail in the real world?
2984;1;I am confused as to why almost every day there is a group of people with motorcycles who smoke and hang out near the road leading to the motorcycle parking area at Binus. At first, I thought they were not Binus students, but the next day I noticed that they were wearing Binus student ID cards. If I were asked whether it is disturbing or not, the answer is both yes and no. Yes, because personally I feel a bit uncomfortable, and no, because I cannot really forbid them from gathering there. After all, it is a public space and they are not disturbing others, so I just let it be.
2985;1;For those who applied for internships outside of Binus and have already been accepted, is the status on the website still pending?
2986;0;Vaneciav, I love you haha
2987;1;Guys, why are there no more independent internships that last 6 to 12 months? The longest now is only about 4 to 5 months.
2988;1;If we are asked to testify because we witnessed an incident, that means we will be required to attend a trial, right? That takes up our time. Will the police compensate us for the time spent?
